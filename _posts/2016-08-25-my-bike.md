*This post is written for an individual who tried to school me about my fixie*

Imagine this, your riding along on your bike ride into work, dude rolls up next you on his fixie, and says,
 "you've got the wront dropouts, that's not safe". To which I laugh and then say, "it's not a problem". To
 which he says, "well, it's harder to adjust the wheel". I conceeded this point, "yes, it is, but my frame
 was way less expensive". Mind you, we were having this conversation over the course of a block, between
 lights. After the next light, I left him and his pretty black fixing with matching purple hubs in the dust
 (after doing an obligatory track stop while waiting for the light to turn).

# What *is* important on a bike?

So if he could have kept up with me, and we had more time, I would have told him what is more important than dropouts.
 Here is a picture of my bike:

The first thing you will notice is that it's a Falcon. This is a rare bike to find these days, as they went out of
 business [years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Cycles). This was a British bike manufacturer, and the
 frame is from sometime close to when I was born (visit the wiki page, it's like Schwinn, completely different now).
 You might notice something interesting about that frame. It's rusty. Don't worry, it's solid, but it looks like crap.
 The looks like crap part was important.

I live in San Francisco, bikes are stolen all the time. I wanted a bike that noone in their right mind would go through
 the effort of trying to steal this thing, but looks can be deceiving. I put this bike together about 14 years ago. The
 first thing I did was go and find a frame. I walked into a used bike shop, and asked for the crappiest looking frame,
 that was actually still in good condition, oh and was 57 cm. The guy pulled the frame off the wall, at this point all
 that was on the bike was the front fork and headset, it had a bottom bracket (the part where the bike pedal crank arms
 attach/pass through to the bike) and that's it. It cost me a whopping 25$. This was going to be a fixie, so I asked the
 guy to grab used parts for everything, but I handed him the 42 tooth front chainring, and a rear flip-flop hub and wheel
 that came with 15 tooth sprockets, areo bars and a used nitto stem to use for the build. A week later I went in and
 grabbed the bike and started riding. I won't get into learning to ride a fixed gear bike here, but let's just say that
 it's interesting.

# The upgrades

Fixed gear bikes take more stress in different areas of the bike that do standard road bikes. The first is at the neck
 of the bike, where the fork passes through frame.

## First upgrade: the headset

I started noticing that the headset had a lot of play (wiggled a lot). I tried to adjust it myself a bunch, but it was
 clear a new headset was needed. I got a Shimano 105 headset. 105 is not the best, and it's not the worst. In my opinion
 it is the most solid. The reason this part went bad is that when your climbing hills on a fixie, you put a lot of stress
 on the headset as you rock the bike back and forth. Since you can't change gears, you need to push a lot with your arms
 side-to-side.

## Second upgrade: the bottom bracket

Similarly to everything else, the bottom bracket takes a lot of stress when your pushing down hard with your legs. Again
 this is more stress than normal. Shimano 105 comes to the rescue again.

## Third upgrade: pedals and cranks

While obvious to some, on a fixed gear bike, if the bike is moving then so are the pedals. This can be challenging on hills,
 which is why you'll notice I cheat by having a [front brake](?#1). While in turns though, you get to
 learn something new about cycling, the pedal scratch. When this happens, try not to freak out. You're pedal hits the ground,
 causing your rear wheel to temporarily leave the ground, and then your heart skips a beat, as you realize you have lost
 control and are about to hit a car coming up that narrow street you're turning on to. When your rear wheel levels the ground
 your momentum tries to continue in a straight line rather than staying on the curve. Of course, the thought of "why am I 
 riding a fixed gear?", seriously, it's not that cool people. This only lasts for a millisecond, once your pedal rotates a
 little more, your rear wheel will reconnect with the road, and then ideally you don't fall. After doing this more than once,
 you start researching for replacement parts. Answer, shorter crank arms, and narrower pedals, specifically, I really like the
 MKS narrow track pedals. Pedal scratches are now rare.

While on pedals, I like the confedence that I get with straps and clips. On my road bike, clipless is the way to go, but this
 is my city bike. I want to wear regular shoes, and that strap is important. When stopping, you need to pull up on the strap
 to help slow down. They're also immensely helpful for pulling up on uphills, but not as good as clipless pedals and shoes.

## Fourth and most important upgrade: the rear hub
  
Here is a closer picture of that area:

![Rear hub]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bike-hub.png)

I initially had a cheap flip-flop hub. In theory flip-flops allow you to choose between the free-wheel and the fixed-wheel
 sides. I learned two things with this: first, don't buy weak stuff for your bike; second,
 it takes enough work to mount your rear-wheel that you will never flip it. One day while stopping on my bike, I had a huge
 surprise, I was pushing back hard to slow down and then *pling* I was no longer stopping. I ran into my friend in front of
 me, but luckily had slowed down enough that neither of us got hurt. Let's not concern ourselves with what would have
 happened if he wasn't in front of me. I replaced that crappy hub, with the greatest hub ever, the Phil Wood hub, $150 worth
 pure awesomeness, with a 13 tooth sprocket. 42/13 is a pretty decent compromise between speed vs. power, aka downhills vs.
 uphills. I'm thinking of dropping down one more to 42/12 when I upgrade these components, but it's pretty close to perfect.
