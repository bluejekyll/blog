*This post is written for an individual who tried to school me about my fixie*

Imagine this, your riding along on your bike ride into work, dude rolls up next you on his fixie, and says,
 "you've got the wront dropouts, that's not safe". To which I laugh and then say, "it's not a problem". To
 which he says, "well, it's harder to adjust the wheel". I conceeded this point, "yes, it is, but my frame
 was way less expensive". Mind you, we were having this conversation over the course of a block, between
 lights. After the next light, I left him and his pretty black fixing with matching purple hubs in the dust
 (after doing an obligatory track stop while waiting for the light to turn).

# What *is* important on a bike?

So if he could have kept up with me, and we had more time, I would have told him what is more important than dropouts.
 Here is a picture of my bike:

The first thing you will notice is that it's a falcon
