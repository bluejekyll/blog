I compiled libvirt and I couldn't get polkit to allow a non-priviledged user to use qemu:///system. So here are the notes and why this ended up happening.\nFirst of all, whenever compiling a piece of software, I always use --prefix to make sure I don't clobber any system files managed by whatever OS you use. Personally I did this on Ubuntu.\nFirst download the version of libvirt you want, for my project I wanted to make sure I was compatible with 0.9.4 (the whole reason I couldn't use the version available from apt):\n$&gt; wget http://libvirt.org/sources/libvirt-0.9.4.tar.gz\n\nThe instructions on libvirts site tell you to do the basic gnu configure steps, i.e. ./configure, make, make install, but this is much too simplistic in my opinion and would potentially clobber system files.\nHere are my steps:\n$&gt; tar -xzvf libvirt-0.9.4.tar.gz\n$&gt; cd libvirt-0.9.4\n$&gt; make clean\n\nAnd my configuration options:\n$&gt; ./configure --prefix=/opt/libvirt --with-polkit --with-app-armor --with-capng --with-qemu\n\nFor any errors you'll probably need to make sure you install certain dev packages of common things, like libapparmor-dev etc.\n$&gt; make\n$&gt; sudo make install\n\nNow here are somethings that are screwed up after installation:\n# permissions on the directories in the install path are wrong\n$&gt; sudo find /opt/libvirt -type d -exec chmod go+rx {} \\;\n\n# I want to use actual /var not the one in the /opt/libvirt\n$&gt; sudo rm -r /opt/libvirt/var &amp;&amp; pushd /opt/libvirt &amp;&amp; sudo ln -s /var &amp;&amp; popd\n\nHere's the thing with polkit that I had missed and spent many hours trying to figure out, of course it was self imposed. virsh and the Java binding Connect kept giving me this error:\nerror: Failed to connect to the hypervisor\nerror: authentication failed: authentication failed\n\npolkit is a cool system, which I didn't know well until I ran into having to get this next thing setup. The purpose of polkit is to allow non-privileged users access to perform certain actions without the need of promoting to root via sudo. This is important if like me you want to use libvirt's Java bindings, you don't really want to run your JVM as root, do you? Anyway, polkit requires some configuration, first is that you need to define the new actions. Normally make install would do this properly, but since we specified a different --prefix, it ended up installing the action definitions in /opt/libvirt/share. To add it to the actual system just add a new link (that way if you ever reinstall, the link will point to the new file, as opposed to having to remember to copy it each time).\n$&gt; pushd /usr/share/polkit-1/actions &amp;&amp; sudo ln -s /opt/libvirt/share/polkit-1/actions/org.libvirt.unix.policy &amp;&amp; popd\n\nNow install the new file that grants non-root users access to perform the libvirt actions\n$&gt; cat &gt; 50-libvirt-remote-access.pkla &lt;&lt;END\n[libvirt Management Access]\nIdentity=unix-group:libvirt\nAction=org.libvirt.unix.manage\nResultAny=yes\nResultInactive=yes\nResultActive=yes\n\n[libvirt Monitor Access]\nIdentity=unix-group:users\nAction=org.libvirt.unix.monitor\nResultAny=yes\nResultInactive=yes\nResultActive=yes\nEND\n\n$&gt; sudo cp 50-libvirt-remote-access.pkla /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d\n\nNotice that the group for management is libvirt and monitoring is any user on the system. You will need to make sure both that the group exists (see /etc/group and groupadd) and that your user is a member (see id, and usermod).\nWith all of that setup, now you just need to make sure that your environment is setup, add this to your .bashrc or equivalent:\nexport LIBVIRT_HOME=/opt/libvirt\nexport PATH=$LIBVIRT_HOME/bin:$PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBVIRT_HOME/lib\nexport PYTHONPATH=$LIBVIRT_HOME/lib/python2.6/site-packages\n\nMake sure to login or create a new terminal to reload your shell. Other things to note, I didn't mention starting libvirtd, you will need to do this. If you put things in the paths I specified this would be in /opt/libvirt/sbin/libvirtd. You probably will want this to be started automatically. If you need an upstart script, post a comment, and I can post one. Otherwise, you can just modify the one that is installed with the system to point to the proper location for everything.\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/compiling-libvirt-and-continuing-use-of-polkit/","title":"Compiling libvirt and continuing use of polkit"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/osgi-classpaths-and-jersey/":{"body":"Since writing this, I do not recommend OSGi any more, just use DropWizard\nOSGi is cool, but it adds a ton of classpath constraints. I'll put up a complete OSGi page about some of the headaches I've run into and the basic setup I use at a later date, but today I want to share how to get rid of a ClassNotFoundException when trying to deploy Jersey.\nIf you're not familiar with Jersey it's an implementation from Sun/Oracle of the JAX-RS spec.

I'd doubled checked that I had these bundles installed and started (maven dependencies):\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.jersey&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1.12&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.jersey&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-server&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1.12&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.jersey&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-servlet&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1.12&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n\nThey were right there in the OSGi runtime: \"Active\". So what was up? The answer lies in how I was referencing the Jersey context in my web.xml:\n&lt;servlet&gt;\n  &lt;servlet-name&gt;com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n  &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\n  &lt;init-param&gt;\n    &lt;param-name&gt;javax.ws.rs.Application&lt;/param-name&gt;\n    &lt;param-value&gt;com.my.Application&lt;/param-value&gt;\n  &lt;/init-param&gt;\n  &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;\n&lt;/servlet&gt;\n&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\n  &lt;servlet-name&gt;com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\n\nIt turns out this is the only reference to the ServletContainer anywhere in my \"code\", in the web.xml. I use the maven-bundle-plugin for generating the bundles. The Bnd tool at the core of that plugin automatically collects all the Import-Packages from what's being imported in your Java code.\nThe classpath in OSGi is partly derived from your Import-Package statement, and since nowhere in my code was I explicitly referencing the ServletContainer, that class was never made available on the classpath.\nSolution, changed the configuration of the maven-bundle-plugin to add the package to the Import-Package statement:\n&lt;Import-Package&gt;com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet,*&lt;/Import-Package&gt;\n\nAnd then Jersey was deployed, and the world was calm.\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/osgi-classpaths-and-jersey/","title":"OSGi Classpaths and Jersey"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/osgi-jetty-jersey/":{"body":"Since writing this, I do not recommend OSGi any more, just use DropWizard\nThis is a mini how-to on setting up Jersey (JAX-RS) with Jetty running in OSGi. I wouldn't necessarily say that this the recommended setup, and I encourage comments for better ways of doing what I've done.\nFirst off if you're not familiar with Jersey and JAX-RS, I'd recommend looking at it. It's a framework for developing RESTful applications using annotations and other methods to simplify deploying said applications. What's nice about this is you get to forget about all the boiler-plate code and just develop. Another cool feature is that if you write your code properly, then you can test it without the need of doing a full integration test (though, it's still a good idea to have those).\nOk, first step, make sure your web-app's bundle is setup correctly for Jetty, put this in your manifest:\nWeb-ContextPath: /bfry\n\nThe bfry being the root path of the web-app. When Jetty starts up, you should see some logs about the web-app being loaded. For this to work, in addition to the standard Jetty dependencies, I use these:\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.jetty.osgi&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;jetty-osgi-boot&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;${jetty.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.jetty.osgi&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;jetty-httpservice&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;${jetty.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n\nWith that, your standard web-app should be loaded with your OSGi startup. Hooking up Jersey with OSGi takes a little more work. Your WEB-INF/web.xml file should be read by Jetty with the above config. This configuration will install Jersey:\n&lt;servlet&gt;\n  &lt;servlet-name&gt;com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n  &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\n  &lt;init-param&gt;\n    &lt;param-name&gt;javax.ws.rs.Application&lt;/param-name&gt;\n    &lt;param-value&gt;benjaminfry.api.BenjaminFryApplication&lt;/param-value&gt;\n  &lt;/init-param&gt;\n&lt;/servlet&gt;\n&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\n  &lt;servlet-name&gt;com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\n\nWhat this says is that the BenjaminFryApplication (which I'll show you the code for below), should be the basis for the Jersey Container. There may be other (and perhaps better) ways to do this, but this works well for me. The Application is installed at /bfry/*, so all requests to this location will go through Jersey. Here's the code for the Application:\npackage benjaminfry.api;\n\n\nimport org.apache.log4j.Logger;\nimport org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;\nimport org.osgi.framework.ServiceReference;\n\n\nimport javax.servlet.ServletContext;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.Application;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.Context;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.Set;\n\n\n/**\n * This is the Jersey Application implementation for passing back references to the Jersey Resource handlers.\n *  In this example there are two resources, one is the LocationResource which implements the Location app.\n *  The other is the OSGiResource with is wired up with the OSGiService\n *  so that it has access to OSGi system. The LocationResource does not, so I won't show that one.\n */\npublic class BenjaminFryApplication extends Application {\n    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(BenjaminFryApplication.class);\n\n\n    private final Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; resourceClasses;\n    private final Set&lt;Object&gt; resourceSingletons;\n\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor for the Application. This wires up all the Resources and stores the final map for retrieval\n     *  at any point.\n     * @param sc ServletContext is automatically passed in from the Jersey framework, this is used to retrieve the OSGi\n     *           BundleContext which is specified by Jetty through its OSGi support.\n     */\n    public BenjaminFryApplication(@Context ServletContext sc) {\n        try {\n            BundleContext bundleContext = (BundleContext)sc.getAttribute(\"osgi-bundlecontext\");\n            if (bundleContext == null) throw new IllegalStateException(\"osgi-bundlecontext not registered\");\n\n\n            ServiceReference&lt;OSGiResource&gt; ref = bundleContext.getServiceReference(OSGiResource.class);\n            if (ref == null) throw new IllegalStateException(OSGiResource.class.getSimpleName() + \" not registered\");\n            OSGiResource osgiResource = bundleContext.getService(ref);\n\n\n            resourceSingletons = Collections.&lt;Object&gt;singleton(meanResource);\n            resourceClasses = Collections.&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt;singleton(LocationResource.class);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            logger.error(e);\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * @return per request Jersey Resources which are used to create objects for handling the request.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClasses() {\n        return resourceClasses;\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * @return singleton Jersey Resources, these are pre-constructed objects, each one needs to be idempotent and\n     *  thread safe.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public Set&lt;Object&gt; getSingletons() {\n        return resourceSingletons;\n    }\n}\n\nIn the above code there are some things to point out. The Jersey system supports different types of context information being passed in as parameters with the @Context annotation. The ServletContext has an attribute that is set by the Jetty OSGi system with the BundleContext for our OSGi Bundle. With this BundleContext we get a reference to the registered OSGiResource. The method getSingletons() is used by Jersey to get references to the Jersey REST Servlets. Each of these objects must be threadsafe, reentrant, etc.\nHere's the code for the Jersey REST Servlet which also, through the use of OSGi Dynamic Services, is registered with the OSGi System:\npackage benjaminfry.api;\n\n\nimport aQute.bnd.annotation.component.Component;\nimport aQute.bnd.annotation.component.Reference;\nimport benjaminfry.osgi.pub.OSGiService;\nimport com.sun.jersey.spi.resource.Singleton;\n\n\nimport javax.ws.rs.*;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.Response;\n\n\n/**\n * OSGiResource is the Jersey resource for giving access to the OSGi Service.\n *  the path is bfry/osgi/*, anything outside this path will return a 404. This is defined as an\n *  OSGi DynamicServices Component which will instantiate the object and register it with OSGi automatically.\n */\n@Component(provide = OSGiResource.class)\n@Path(\"osgi/{myParam}\")\n@Singleton\npublic class OSGiResource {\n    private volatile OSGiService osgiService;\n\n\n    /**\n     * Only registered the get method for retrieving the mean and variance for the specified httpCode.\n     */\n    @GET\n    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)\n    public String get(@PathParam(\"myParam\") String myParam) {\n        if (meanService == null) throw new WebApplicationException(Response.serverError().entity(\"osgiService is not set\").build());\n\n\n        String myValue = osgiService.getMyValue(myParam);\n        return myValue;\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * OSGi Dynamic Services reference for wiring up the osgiService.\n     */\n    @Reference\n    public void setOSGiService(OSGiService osgiService) {\n        this.meanService = meanService;\n    }\n\n\n    public void unsetOSGiService(OSGiService osgiService) {\n        this.osgiService = null;\n    }\n}\n\nThis class has Jersey and Bndlib annotations intermingled, and yes it works. The @Component specifies that this application should be registered with OSGi. @Path is a Jersey annotation that specifies the location of this REST servlet, with the addition of the web.xml config from above it means this would be located at /bfry/osgi/{myParam}. The {myParam} portion tells Jersey that myParam is a path parameter (which can be a regex, look at the Jersey docs). The @PathParam tells Jersey which variable of the get() method to pass the path parameter to.\nThe lifecycle of this object works like this; The BenjaminFryApplication gets a reference to the OSGiResource service, this causes the OSGi environment to initialize the OSGiResource object to be initialized. During initialization, the OSGi Dynamic Services framework links up the field osgiService via the setOSGiService() method. When a request is made, Jersey looks up the path information say related to the request 'http://localhost/bfry/osgi/someParam'. Jersey sees the GET request, and calls the get() method based on the @GET annotation.\nThere are some cool things here, but the most interesting thing I think is that this \"servlet\" can actually be unit tested, no need for an integration test, because of the annotations. The unit test merely needs to construct the object, set either a mocked OSGiService implementation or a real implementation, and then call the get() method with whatever data you want to test. No need to start up Jetty at all for your tests! This makes testing the logic of the servlet simpler and the test itself more reliable. I'm not going to show this, it should be pretty obvious.\nREST easy.\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/osgi-jetty-jersey/","title":"OSGi, Jersey and Jetty"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/":{"body":"","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/","title":"Posts"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/a-year-of-rust-and-dns/":{"body":"Approximately a year and a half ago I discovered possibly the greatest\nprogramming language ever created. It happened while I was learning Go. Go was\na fun language to learn, and coming from Java I appreciated one\nparticularly awesome thing about it, I could compile a single binary, deploy\nand run it quickly and easily. Honestly, I hadn't realized how much I missed\nstatic binaries from C until I wrote a program in Go. There was no classpath, no monkeying with the\ndefault memory settings, no changing the default garbage collector. It was a\nnice language, but I had some problems. I missed generics, I missed typed and\nchecked exceptions, and I couldn't help but feel like I was writing C but with\na Garbage Collector (ok, easier than C and it has memory safety, big bonuses).\nThen I started seeing Hacker News talking about this new language called\nRust. It was marching toward a 1.0 release, I think\nit was at 0.8 when I first tried it out. With the help of\nRust by Example I sat down and started learning\nthe language, every time I wrote something there was an old hardened layer of\nprogramming tarnish that was wiped from my eyes. I had been shown the\nlight, and there is no going back once you have been to the promised land. All\nof my colleagues have gotten tired of me talking about Rust... I definitely\nfeel like a bible thumper sometimes. But at that point, I still didn't have anything\nsubstantial that I had written in Rust.\nThen the computer gods said, \"rewrite DNS\"\nCVE-2015-5477 struck BIND9, and it sounded pretty bad. After doing a little research\nit became somewhat clear, to me anyway, that BIND's biggest issue is that it is written in C;\nbuffer overflows, out-of-bound array access, race conditions, etc. Take a look\nat the full list\nsometime, I think roughly 50% of those could have been avoided by using\n(safe) Rust. Is BIND9 the only DNS server out there? No. But it is the most\nwidely deployed.\nBefore you call me a C hater, C is still probably my most favorite language.\nIt's pure, raw power. It's also a huge pain in the neck to debug, and there's\nalways that question, like what happens when you call strstr() on a non-null\nterminated buffer? (yes, that was a fun one to track down, Kevin G.).\nSo I got started. Here is the first disappointing thing, there is no spec! What\nexists are rfc's dating back to 1987, specifically\nrfc1034 and rfc1035.\nLuckily the IETF marks the status of rfc's (the color coding at the top of the\nrfc page), and then it also forward and backward references to rfc's that\nupdate the current rfc or the ones which it obsolete's. My first job was to\norganize all of the rfc's that I planned on implementing (this list keeps\nchanging by-the-way), obviously starting with rfc1035.\nSo then I got started, on-the-side; and by the way I have two small children\nand a full-time job, so\non-the-side for me is not always the easiest time to come up with. Anywhere close\nto six hours a week is impressive.\nA DNS client and server is born\nFrom the README.md:\n# trust-dns\nA Rust based DNS server\n\nThe commit:\ncommit a3496cebf37c5e88bfbd4d7c5f036afe1d61cf6d\nAuthor: Benjamin Fry &lt;benjaminfry@me.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Aug 7 19:47:12 2015 -0700\n\n    Initial commit\n\nIt took me a few weeks to mostly complete rfc1035, the basics. The first\nthing that I really started appreciating about Rust were the well defined\nfixed size integers u8, u16, u32, u64. It was actually fun to parse\nbinary streams again! I've been working in Java mainly for the last decade,\nI never found bit shifting intuitive in Java because there are only signed\nintegers. So this was like going back to C. Example DNS header parsing\n(current as of this writing):\nfn read(decoder: &amp;mut BinDecoder) -&gt; DecodeResult&lt;Self&gt; {\n  let id = try!(decoder.read_u16());\n\n  let q_opcd_a_t_r = try!(decoder.pop());\n  // if the first bit is set\n  let message_type = if (0x80 &amp; q_opcd_a_t_r) == 0x80 { MessageType::Response } else { MessageType::Query };\n  // the 4bit opcode, masked and then shifted right 3bits for the u8...\n  let op_code: OpCode = ((0x78 &amp; q_opcd_a_t_r) &gt;&gt; 3).into();\n  let authoritative = (0x4 &amp; q_opcd_a_t_r) == 0x4;\n  let truncation = (0x2 &amp; q_opcd_a_t_r) == 0x2;\n  let recursion_desired = (0x1 &amp; q_opcd_a_t_r) == 0x1;\n\n  let r_z_ad_cd_rcod = try!(decoder.pop()); // fail fast...\n  let recursion_available = (0b1000_0000 &amp; r_z_ad_cd_rcod) == 0b1000_0000;\n  let authentic_data = (0b0010_0000 &amp; r_z_ad_cd_rcod) == 0b0010_0000;\n  let checking_disabled = (0b0001_0000 &amp; r_z_ad_cd_rcod) == 0b0001_0000;\n  let response_code: u8 = 0x0F &amp; r_z_ad_cd_rcod;\n\n  let query_count = try!(decoder.read_u16());\n  let answer_count = try!(decoder.read_u16());\n  let name_server_count = try!(decoder.read_u16());\n  let additional_count = try!(decoder.read_u16());\n\n  Ok(Header { id: id, message_type: message_type, op_code: op_code, authoritative: authoritative,\n    truncation: truncation, recursion_desired: recursion_desired,\n    recursion_available: recursion_available,\n    authentic_data: authentic_data, checking_disabled: checking_disabled,\n    response_code: response_code,\n    query_count: query_count, answer_count: answer_count,\n    name_server_count: name_server_count, additional_count: additional_count })\n  }\n\nIn each of those operations, I know exactly what is stored at each bit in each\nof those variables. I haven't gone back and changed it in some cases yet, but\nI've decided to start using this binary int format for checking bits, as I\nthink it's more clear (as opposed to hex, which you can still see in the above\ncode block. I need to clean that up, but if it ain't broke don't fix it):\n  let recursion_available = (0b1000_0000 &amp; r_z_ad_cd_rcod) == 0b1000_0000;\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with rust, the result of the == operation is a boolean,\nso the type of recursion_available is inferred. Also, I know my names look\nfunny, but each of those characters represents a bit, or more to help me visually\nunderstand the bitfield I'm reading from.\nIn this bitshift example:\n  let op_code: OpCode = ((0x78 &amp; q_opcd_a_t_r) &gt;&gt; 3).into();\n\nIf that operation happened on a 32bit boundary in Java, I'd be scratching my head\n(actually a junit test would be easier) trying to remember if I needed &gt;&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;. I know the the answer, do you? In Rust there is no question. I will\nbe changing that above line to this, because I think it's much clearer:\n  let op_code: OpCode = ((0b0_1111_0_0_0 &amp; q_opcd_a_t_r) &gt;&gt; 3).into();\n\nI have to say, some of the ergonomics of Rust are awesome, like support for the\nbinary literal, Java just got this in 1.7. And the allowance of the _ for\nvisually separating portions of the literal is awesome, obviously most people\nwill usually use it as a replacement for , like let million = 1_000_000.\nDisecting the above code a little more, that into() is a function from the\nFrom trait implementation:\nimpl From&lt;u8&gt; for OpCode {\n  fn from(value: u8) -&gt; Self {\n    match value {\n      0 =&gt; OpCode::Query,\n      2 =&gt; OpCode::Status,\n      4 =&gt; OpCode::Notify,\n      5 =&gt; OpCode::Update,\n      _ =&gt; panic!(\"unimplemented code: {}\", value),\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe above code shows a basic usage of match on integer and conversion to the\nDNS OpCode enum. Notice that panic!, yeah, that's a logic bug.\nI just filed the issue\nfor it, basically that panic! will crash the server if someone sends a bad\nOpCode. This brings up an important point:\nRust does not prevent logic bugs\nRust prevents memory leaks[1], a subset of concurrency bugs, and others. It's not\nsome magic bullet, but to not have to deal with memory access issues? Null\npointer dereferences? Memory leaks[1]? Yeah, there was a reason I went to Java all\nthose years ago. But now, I can go back to systems level programming with even\nbetter safety guarantees than Java!\nThat panic! is residual from when I was still getting comfortable with errors\nin Rust. There are some error handling changes coming in Rust\nthat will make them easier, and error_chain\nis greatly simplifies error type definitions, example.\nI thought I had removed all panic! use cases from areas where they would be\nencountered in live code paths, I never claimed to be perfect! (And writing\nthis post helped uncover a bug, so even if no one reads this, it was worth it).\nYou must deal with errors\nRust has made errors something you can not ignore. This is akin to checked\nexceptions in Java (by the way, I'm in the camp of all Exceptions should be\nchecked). Rust uses a similar practice to Java in that, if you don't know how\nto deal with an error, just rethrow it (best practice in Java). I'll be converting\nthat above From to something else soon, but let's look at the simplest form of\nerror handling:\n  let query_count = try!(decoder.read_u16());\n\nThis reads from the decoder byte stream the next u16. Of course this could fail,\nbecause maybe there isn't enough bytes left to read a u16, or maybe it's a backed\nby a TcpStream and the connection fails. But in this context, what can I do\nwith an error like that? Nothing really, there is no way to recover, so we rethrow.\nThat's what try! does, but in Rust it's not quite as simple as in Java, Rust\nis statically typed. I won't get into error handling in this article, except to\npoint out a pain point with it, you can learn more about error handling here.\nRust has made the wise decision to force you to either propagate errors through\nthe Result type, or handle them. Because Rust is strongly typed, every function\ncall which returns an Error will need to compensate for all the inner functions called.\nIn the above example, we only need to deal with the DecodeError returned from\nread_u16(), but in the Client::query() we return ClientError, which is\nis just a union of a bunch of different types:\nlinks {\n  super::decode_error::Error, super::decode_error::ErrorKind, Decode;\n  super::encode_error::Error, super::encode_error::ErrorKind, Encode;\n}\n\nWhile the type itself isn't growing because enums in Rust are more equivalent to\nunions in C, the definition is expanding with each additional Error. The Client\nends up with the potential for DecodeError or EncodeError because it's obviously\nperforming both operations to send and then receive a message. The overhead of\ndealing with this was daunting initially, but since better understanding the\nproblem, it's no longer a significant overhead, and again error_chain has\nmade it even easier.\nImplementing rfc1035 was deceivingly easy\nAfter a few iterations on the server code and authority, in September of 2015\nI had a fully functional DNS server and client. But that's not what I set out\nto do. I set out to implement DNSSec, threw in DNSCrypt for fun, and wanted a\ndynamic library of which I could be proud.\nThis brings me to a lull point; DNSSec, how hard could it be? Remember I\nmentioned all those rfc's? Well DNSSec has gone through a few revisions, there\nis a trail of dead rfc carcasses that can be followed: rfc2065 (1997), obsoleted\nby rfc2535 (1999), obsoleted by rfc4033, rfc4034, and rfc4035 (2005), which have some\nvery important clarifications in rfc6840 (2013). I missed one in there and fixed it\nrecently, see issue #27.\nWhich stems from this brilliant quote:\n The guidance in the above paragraph differs from what has been\n   published before but is consistent with current common practice.\n   Item 3 of Section 6.2 of [RFC4034] says that names in both of these\n   RR types should be converted to lowercase.  The earlier [RFC3755]\n   says that they should not.  Current practice follows neither document\n   fully.\n\nDid you catch that? No one implemented the spec properly, so now the spec is\nthe implementation. I think that's a tail wagging the dog, right?\nAnyway, back to the deceivingly easy bit; perhaps a picture will help:\n\nAt blindmans peak, I was riding high. Loving Rust, nothing could stop me. I\nhad fun adding in support for things like the async io library mio\n(I have plans to move to futures\nwhen I have time). Then I decided it was\ntime to add DNSSec support. I had to read, and reread, all of the mentioned\nrfcs, and some others. I started implementing, and then fell into the pit of\ndispair as I tried and tried to get RRSIGs to first parse and then validate\nproperly. Only to discover that I needed additional methods\nin the Rust OpenSSL port. After learning too much about OpenSSL (oh-my-dear-god I can\nnot unsee what I saw in there, the C, not Rust).\nWhile in the pit of dispair, I considered many times giving up, with questions like; \"What's\nthe point?\", \"There are a ton of DNS servers out there, DJB's is rock solid.\nAm I really adding anything new?\", \"Is anyone even\ngoing to use this?\" I have good answers to all of these, that will eventually\nmake this implementation unique and offer features that answer long standing\nissues that I've had with DNS. So, I slogged through, and made some progress.\nThen I discovered that none of my signing logic was working properly. This\nbrought me to the valley of doom, those questions I was asking myself, they\nonly got louder and louder. \"Stop wasting your time.\" But how could I stop? I\nmade it this far, I must see it through. I needed to go back and reread all the\nDNSSec rfc's, and understand what I had screwed up.\nThen I climbed saviors peak, which was hard. For any cyclists in the Bay Area,\nit's like the Three Bears ride in the East Bay, where the Baby Bear and Mamma Bear hills were\ntough, then Papa Bear hill has a false summit, and you still need to go up\nthe huge last climb to get to the top. The downhill is totally worth it though,\n45mph is thrilling on a bike.\nTests as a way of life\nA feature that I found both surprising, and yet seems so obvious it should be\ninherent to all languages, was the embedded tests\nwith a simple #[test] annotation which causes a test binary to be produced\nwith the cargo test command. In most languages you usually start by writing\na simple main() with a println!(\"hello world\"), in Rust it's even easier to\nstart with a test. I have &gt; 84% coverage, I can do better, but if you look at the\nreports,\nthe most glaringly uncovered things are actually covered, but in integration\ntests, cargo test -- --ignored, which I'm not currently running on Travis.\nTCP servers on a free CI service seem like issues will follow. I've never been\na huge fan of aiming too much higher than 85-90% coverage, because I see\ndiminishing returns beyond that, as Dijkstra said:\n testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs,\n                but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence\n\nMy favorite though is the ability to write threaded tests for server code, in Rust it's\nmade even easier than similar practices I've used in Java:\n#[test]\nfn test_server_www_udp() {\n  let addr = SocketAddr::V4(SocketAddrV4::new(Ipv4Addr::new(127,0,0,1), 0));\n  let udp_socket = UdpSocket::bound(&amp;addr).unwrap();\n\n  let ipaddr = udp_socket.local_addr().unwrap();\n  println!(\"udp_socket on port: {}\", ipaddr);\n\n  thread::Builder::new().name(\"test_server:udp:server\".to_string()).spawn(move || server_thread_udp(udp_socket)).unwrap();\n\n  let client_conn = UdpClientConnection::new(ipaddr).unwrap();\n  let client_thread = thread::Builder::new().name(\"test_server:udp:client\".to_string()).spawn(move || client_thread_www(client_conn)).unwrap();\n\n  let client_result = client_thread.join();\n\n  assert!(client_result.is_ok(), \"client failed: {:?}\", client_result);\n}\n\nTeasing this apart, it creates two threads, one for the client, and one for the server.\nBoth use random local ports, so that we don't have any issues with binding to an\nalready used socket address. Then we start the server. Next we grab the server's\nrandomly assigned port, pass that into a new Client and start the client thread.\nIn tests, I see unwrap() and panic! as perfectly legit. The server thread is dead simple:\nfn server_thread_udp(udp_socket: UdpSocket) {\n  let catalog = new_catalog();\n\n  let mut server = Server::new(catalog);\n  server.register_socket(udp_socket);\n\n  server.listen().unwrap();\n}\n\nI started writing tests like this in Java years ago for distributed systems, but\nthis is much easier than the primitives I had at my disposal in Java. The client\nthread is where the meat of the test is:\nfn client_thread_www&lt;C: ClientConnection&gt;(conn: C) {\n  let name = Name::with_labels(vec![\"www\".to_string(), \"example\".to_string(), \"com\".to_string()]);\n  println!(\"about to query server: {:?}\", conn);\n  let client = Client::new(conn);\n\n  let response = client.query(&amp;name, DNSClass::IN, RecordType::A).expect(\"error querying\");\n\n  assert!(response.get_response_code() == ResponseCode::NoError, \"got an error: {:?}\", response.get_response_code());\n\n  let record = &amp;response.get_answers()[0];\n  assert_eq!(record.get_name(), &amp;name);\n  assert_eq!(record.get_rr_type(), RecordType::A);\n  assert_eq!(record.get_dns_class(), DNSClass::IN);\n\n  if let &amp;RData::A(ref address) = record.get_rdata() {\n    assert_eq!(address, &amp;Ipv4Addr::new(93,184,216,34))\n  } else {\n    assert!(false);\n  }\n\n  let mut ns: Vec&lt;_&gt; = response.get_name_servers().to_vec();\n  ns.sort();\n\n  assert_eq!(ns.len(), 2);\n  assert_eq!(ns.first().unwrap().get_rr_type(), RecordType::NS);\n  assert_eq!(ns.first().unwrap().get_rdata(), &amp;RData::NS(Name::parse(\"a.iana-servers.net.\", None).unwrap()) );\n  assert_eq!(ns.last().unwrap().get_rr_type(), RecordType::NS);\n  assert_eq!(ns.last().unwrap().get_rdata(), &amp;RData::NS(Name::parse(\"b.iana-servers.net.\", None).unwrap()) );\n}\n\nIf you notice, the function is declared as generic over the ClientConnection type,\nthis allows for a monomorphic function call that works with both TCP and UDP clients,\nmeaning one test for both TCP and UDP servers and clients. I put the code here for an\nexample, you can see the rest of the tests in the server.rs\nsource.\nI know that looking at the Name::with_labels() call looks a little clumsy, I want\nto clean that up, but haven't quite settled on some ideas around String interning\nthat I want to play with. In point of fact, my labels implementation in Name is\none of the very few places where I want a garbage collector in Rust, that desire might\ngo away once I have a better way of performing an intern.\nSo where is Trust-DNS now?\nIt's currently not used in production (as far as I know). I've put a lot of work\ninto validating correctness of what is going on, and have had\nhelp, more\nis always welcome. I want to get a DNS fuzzer running against it to really pound\non it, and then get some benchmark and comparison tests against other servers.\nThings I'm proud of: DNSSec support, with client side validation, and zone\nsigning with local keys. Server and Client both have support for dynamic DNS\nwith SIG0 validation and auth. Journaling support on the Server with sqlite. EDNS is\nsupported for greater than 512 byte UDP packets (defaults to 1500).\nI'm currently in the middle of working on DNSCrypt[2], and then I'll be moving on\nto some more fun ideas. I never imagined it would be this long of a journey,\nbut it's only just beginning, and along with learning such a spectacular language\nit's totally worth it. Thank you to everyone who\nspends so much time perfecting Rust and it's ecosystem, you have reinvigorated\nmy joy of programming.\n(I'll try to post more regularly on progress)\n\n1) I got a lot of feedback on Rust not preventing memory leaks.\nFor me, in my experience it's at least as good as Java, meaning you have to go\nout of your way to cause a situation where a variable will not be dropped. This\ncan happen in safe code. Examples would be ever growing Vectors, or poor usage\nof std::mem::forget which tells Rust not to call drop and cleanup the memory.\nWhen would you want to do this? I've used this when passing objects back to C\nthrough FFI methods, there are other cases. If you want to read a ton, checkout\nthis post: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1066.\nI left what I wrote mostly so that people could come to it, and then read this,\nthink about it, and then realize no language actually prevents memory leaks, but\nRust is memory safe...\n2) After some offline discussion and this issue:\nFeature request: \"RFC 7858, DNS over TLS #38\",\nI'm very much thinking of shelving my work on DNSCrypt and focusing instead on\nDNS over TLS\n\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/a-year-of-rust-and-dns/","title":"A year of Rust and DNS"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/announcing-hickory-dns/":{"body":"Trust-DNS after many years of development is attracting more industry interest. In order to support and protect investment in the project the project is being rebranded to Hickory DNS with properly registered trademarks. This article describes the reasoning behind that change. This post was originally published to the Prossimo blog.\n\nTrust-DNS, a project I started on August 7, 2015, will now be known as Hickory DNS. Since its inception, the project has been an exciting experiment to build a systems level component in the memory safe, low overhead language, Rust. Over the years it's gone from a standard implementation of classic DNS to a toolbox capable of serving many needs. The Hickory DNS project supports DNSSEC, DoT, DoH, and DoQ. It has been used to build stub-resolvers, DNS authorities, experimental recursive resolvers, and low level protocol implementations.  I had a lot of personal goals for this project and with this name change I hope that it will help attract more interest to achieve them all.\nWhy make this change?\nI chose the Trust-DNS name for good reasons, Rust was in the name, and I had the desire to make something trust-worthy. This has always been a project supported out of passion and as it’s attracted more interest from others we want to ensure that it has a future with a more widely appealing identity for consumers, developers, and funders. On top of that, we wanted to select a defensible trademark. The Trust-DNS brand name was deemed to be less defensible since it is a combination of generic words, especially in an industry where any DNS provider will want to talk about the trust their service provides. Hickory in this context is far less likely to occur unintentionally without directly referring to this project. Over the past year there's been a conversation going on with ISRG to receive some support by way of their Prossimo project to add features and robustness to this software. They also intend to eventually use it in Let's Encrypt. Since we are in the midst of a major push to advance functionality, it seemed like a good time to make the necessary changes to the name as well.\nWhere did the name Hickory DNS come from? While considering the goals of this project, trust, security, reliability, safety arose as top priorities; the Hickory tree seemed like a good representation of those goals. A tree has some obvious relationships to the graph in DNS. The Hickory tree itself is a strong hardwood tree that tends to grow straight and look quite elegant. It's known for being hardy, growing all over North America. It’s tough and shock-resistant. These properties are all things that we've grown to appreciate in regards to having developed the project with the Rust language. By choosing something from nature to represent this, we're calling out the organic way in which this project has attracted interest and development from all over the world. As the project’s founder, I hope that with this name we can all feel proud of what's been built so far and recognize how much further the project can grow. Our contribution policies will remain unchanged and we will always welcome new contributions assuming they fit with our goals. We want the trust we've gained over the years to be something which people will continue to rely on.\nHow will this impact existing users and contributors?\nWe will be moving the project into the Hickory DNS organization on GitHub. During this move we will also be changing the project name to Hickory DNS. This transition to an organization and away from my personal github account will allow for a greater set of administrative options for other collaborators, like Dirkjan Ochtman who’s been helping maintain the project for a couple of years now. All of the crates will start being published under the hickory-* name, for example the popular crates trust-dns-resolver and trust-dns-proto will become hickory-resolver and hickory-proto, while the server will be hickory-dns. There may be other changes that need to occur, if others have gone through similar moves, we'd be open to feedback about how to make it most effective. Things that we will not change: licensing (MIT or Apache 2.0), Code of Conduct, and seeking to make the best DNS software available.\nI want to thank the many users of and contributors to the Trust-DNS project and I hope you will join us by continuing to collaborate on the same project under the new name, Hickory DNS. This project would not be where it is without your support of 2,560 commits and 71,318 lines of code written by 170 collaborators. All of that has led to, according to GitHub, 1,136 dependent projects that use the software. Crates.io shows 20,310,799 downloads of the proto crate and 19,003,768 of the resolver crate. With these new investments in the project, we hope to grow the usage of the server and make it something people are comfortable deploying in their production systems. Thank you everyone for your confidence, I am excited for the future of this project, and I hope you are too. If you have any questions or concerns related to this change, feel free to reach out to me. Here's a Hickory tree in the woods near my parents’ house in New York, it’s probably 20 or 30 years old. I hope that together we can build something as beautiful.\n\nAgain, thank you!\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/announcing-hickory-dns/","title":"Announcing Hickory DNS"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/announcing-pg-extend/":{"body":"There were a few things that happened this year that got me excited for the possibilities of stable Rust entering new spaces. They all come in the form of APIs that have become stabilized with a lot of effort from all of the developers contributing to the language. I wish I could say I helped with that effort, I do get to exploit all of that effort in this new project. I want to express my thanks and greatest esteem towards the people who continue to push the language forward, making it more useful and more pleasurable to use. For me to be able to write this, the stabilization of procedural macros, custom allocators, and panic handlers were all necessary. Each of these was stabilized over the last year, thank you!\nPostgres extensions in Rust\nInitially I started playing around with wanting to build Postgres extensions in Rust a while ago, but realized that there was a lot of unstable API work still being done in Rust that I dropped my initial efforts and focused on other things. That's all changed now! I started working in my spare time on this extension library a few weeks ago (which I may have use for in my day job). Building these tools today in stable Rust is possible because a lot of features have stabilized recently. I'm no Postgres internals expert, and have never written an extension for it before, but I decided to do this in the vein of fearlessly taking on problems with Rust.\nGoal\nTo build a library that makes it effortless to create Postgres extensions in Rust. This library needs to do a few things, which are currently implemented as C macros in Postgres header files, hey, my ancient knowledge of C continues to be helpful! As an aside, I still think people should learn C, and this is mostly because it remains the lingua franca for all foreign function interfaces (FFI) between different programming languages (and there's lots of software written in it out there, like Postgres).\nFirst things first, we will need a macro to define the \"module magic\" that informs Postgres that a dynamic library is able to be loaded by it's loader. Next we need to create a way to call into Rust from Postgres such that we can write standard Rust code, without needing to know the inner workings of Postgres and it's conventions in C. This wrapper should also make sure that the FFI boundary is respected between the C and Rust. Finally, we will want to use Postgres' allocator palloc for allocating all memory in the extensions.\nThis might jump the gun a bit, but let's jump straight to the final code example (derived from Postgres C-Language Functions examples):\nuse pg_extern_attr::pg_extern;\nuse pg_extend::{pg_sys, pg_magic};\n\n/// This tells Postgres this library is a Postgres extension\npg_magic!(version: pg_sys::PG_VERSION_NUM);\n\n/// The pg_extern attribute wraps the function in the proper functions syntax for C extensions\n#[pg_extern]\nfn add_one(value: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    (value + 1)\n}\n\n/// Validate that the add_one function works in Rust as expected\n#[test]\nfn test_add_one() {\n    assert_eq!(add_one(1), 2);\n}\n\nFollow the comments above which describe each important section to pay attention to, the full example is available in the repo.\nThis is the way in which the function will be executed in Postgres:\npostgres=# SELECT add_one(3);\n add_one\n---------\n       4\n(1 row)\n\nPrerequisites, we need the C bindings\nBindgen to the rescue! One of the greatest tools in the Rust ecosystem when building FFI code, is bindgen. We're going to use this to define bindings to the Postgres C types we need in Rust. To do this, in the pg_extend crate, we're going to define a pg_sys module and run bindgen in a build.rs script.\nI won't go over this in detail, bindgen has a great set of documentation around it for generating FFI bindings to C. The headers we're using are from the postgres/include/server, and are defined in the wrapper.h file.\nDefining pg_magic\nThe postgres magic macro, pg_magic!(version), does a few different things. The primary goal is to tell Postgres that this is a module it can load. Secondarily, it also sets up some default global variables and functions. Before I display this, I should mention that I did look at the pg_module macro in thehydroimpulse/postgres-extension.rs, so I would be remiss if I didn't mention that it did help point me in the right direction. Let's look at what pg_magic generates, you can use the cargo +nightly expand command to get all macro expansions (I also like cargo doc for viewing all the APIs), see code comments for explanations:\n// We set the allocator to a custom allocator for Postgres, we'll cover this later...\n#[global_allocator]\nstatic GLOBAL: pg_extend::pg_alloc::PgAllocator = pg_extend::pg_alloc::PgAllocator;\n\n// The magic function Postgres looks for on load of the module, without this Postgres will reject\n//    the library. `no_mangle` makes sure that the symbol name is not munged, `link_name` forces\n//    the binding name, It's probably not necessary.\n#[no_mangle]\n#[allow(non_snake_case)]\n#[allow(unused)]\n#[link_name = \"Pg_magic_func\"]\npub extern \"C\" fn Pg_magic_func() -&gt; &amp;'static pg_extend::pg_sys::Pg_magic_struct {\n    use pg_extend::{pg_sys, register_panic_handler};\n    use std::mem::size_of;\n    use std::os::raw::c_int;\n\n    // This defines what configuration the extension was built with, the interface for the `Pg_magic_func`\n    //    returns a reference to this const, to match that which postgres requires.\n    const my_magic: pg_extend::pg_sys::Pg_magic_struct = pg_sys::Pg_magic_struct {\n        len: size_of::&lt;pg_sys::Pg_magic_struct&gt;() as c_int,\n        version: pg_sys::PG_VERSION_NUM as std::os::raw::c_int / 100,\n        // The rest of this options all come from compile time parameters in the Postgres build.\n        funcmaxargs: pg_sys::FUNC_MAX_ARGS as c_int,\n        indexmaxkeys: pg_sys::INDEX_MAX_KEYS as c_int,\n        namedatalen: pg_sys::NAMEDATALEN as c_int,\n        float4byval: pg_sys::USE_FLOAT4_BYVAL as c_int,\n        float8byval: pg_sys::USE_FLOAT8_BYVAL as c_int,\n    };\n\n    // As this is the entry point for the library loading, we use this as an opportunity\n    //    to register a panic handler, so that we can control errors being reported back\n    //    from Rust to C (Postgres). More on this later.\n    register_panic_handler();\n\n    &amp;my_magic\n}\n\nThe pg_magic macro can only be used once in a library. This will become clear with the register_panic_handler which should only be called once (though I don't think it should matter if it happens more than that), and #[global_allocator] can only exist once in a library. I believe this implementation is correct, but if people have opinions on a better way to do this, please reach out.\nNow that we have that, the library is marked as a Postgres extension that can be loaded dynamically.\nUnwrapping pg_extern\nThe pg_extern attribute macro is where all the fun is. There are a number of things it does, and feel free to look at it's implementation. I built this after looking at a lot of documentation, some examples I found online, and the experience I had building this other procedural macro, enum-as-inner. It's not the most straight forward process, but given Rust's type safety, it's generally clear why it's wrong, if not how to fix it (also cargo +nightly expand is a godsend here). I'm not going to walk through the macro implementation here, but rather what it produces (again, see the code comments inline):\n// Again, an unmangled name\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn pg_add_one(\n    // This is the parameter as defined in Postgres,\n    //    it actually is a type alias to `*mut FunctionCallInfoData`.\n    //    it's mutable, because we can use it for returning data from\n    //    the function (though this isn't supported by the library yet)\n    func_call_info: pg_extend::pg_sys::FunctionCallInfo,\n    // The return is a `Datum` type which is actually a type alias to `usize`,\n    //    though we keep this hidden in the library.\n) -&gt; pg_extend::pg_sys::Datum {\n    use std::panic;\n\n    // Here we unsafely get a mutable reference to the `FunctionCallInfoData`,\n    //    again the type is actually `*mut FunctionCallInfoData`. After this point\n    //    the borrow checker will start guaranteeing that we're not doing anything\n    //    untoward with the data.\n    let func_info: &amp;mut pg_extend::pg_sys::FunctionCallInfoData = unsafe {\n        func_call_info\n            .as_mut()\n            .expect(\"func_call_info was unexpectedly NULL\")\n    };\n\n    // We're going to put as much as we can into the catch_unwind block, this\n    //    will allow us to handle the panic, and perform any cleanup with the\n    //    Postgres data that we need to\n    let panic_result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {\n        // This extracts references to the arguments that were passed into the function.\n        let (args, args_null) = pg_extend::get_args(func_info);\n\n        // In this specific example, there is one parameter. It is converted from the\n        //    Datum representation via a conversion defined in the `pg_extend::pg_datum`\n        //    module.\n        let arg_0: i32 = pg_extend::pg_datum::TryFromPgDatum::try_from(\n            pg_extend::pg_datum::PgDatum::from_raw(args[0usize], args_null[0usize]),\n        )\n        // it's safe for us to panic, as there is a panic handler registered.\n        //    (this message can be far better, and will be).\n        .expect(\"unsupported function argument type for arg_0\");\n\n        // Here is the actual function call! We capture it's result.\n        let result = add_one(arg_0);\n\n        // Now we convert the result into a PgDatum, which is our bridge type between this\n        //    library, Rust types, and the `pg_extend::pg_sys` types.\n        pg_extend::pg_datum::PgDatum::from(result)\n    });\n\n    // Here we inspect the panic result\n    match panic_result {\n        Ok(result) =&gt; {\n            // if it's ok, and is_null, then we express that through the `&amp;mut` reference to\n            //    FunctionCallInfoData.\n            func_info.isnull = result.is_null();\n\n            // The PgDatum type has a conversion into the Postgres Datum type. We're outside the\n            //    the catch_unwind block, so it's important this next call never panics, it's\n            //    a direct conversion to Datum in `PgDatum::into_datum` so this should be true.\n            result.into_datum()\n        }\n        Err(err) =&gt; {\n            // In an error case, we're just expressing that there is no data to return.\n            //    In the future there may be more things we identify that should be cleaned up.\n            func_info.isnull = true;\n\n            // Now continue the panic handling.\n            panic::resume_unwind(err)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe above code tries to do as little as possible inside the macro generated code. This is by design, as it's harder to write meta-code than it is to write actual code. Also, more shared library code should help with optimization and code size. I like that so little unsafe code was necessary, but I'm guessing there will be a lot more as we try to implement all the Datum type conversions. All the supported Datum conversions will be available in the pg_extend::pg_datum module (I should note, at the time of this writing there is only a conversion for i32 to and from Datum, not very useful yet).\nThere is also a function which declares the calling convention ABI this function supports:\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn pg_finfo_pg_add_one() -&gt; &amp;'static pg_extend::pg_sys::Pg_finfo_record {\n    const my_finfo: pg_extend::pg_sys::Pg_finfo_record =\n        pg_extend::pg_sys::Pg_finfo_record { api_version: 1 };\n    &amp;my_finfo\n}\n\nWhich is fairly straight forward.\nBy-the-way, this is the first time I've worked with panic handling in Rust, so please reach out if you see anything that looks wrong with the way I've written this. Tonight, I was even informed of a new library for trying to enforce no panics, named no_panic. As I mentioned above that we'd get to the panic handler, so let's look at that.\nErrors and Panic handling\nThe register_panic_handler function is responsible for taking all panics from Rust, and properly (I think) converting them into errors reported to Postgres.\n/// This will replace the current panic_handler\npub fn register_panic_handler() {\n    use std::panic;\n    use crate::pg_error;\n\n    // set (and replace the existing) panic handler, this will tell Postgres that the call failed\n    //   a level of Fatal will force the DB connection to be killed.\n    panic::set_hook(Box::new(|info| {\n        let level = pg_error::Level::Fatal;\n\n        pg_error::log(level, file!(), line!(), module_path!(), format!(\"panic in Rust extension: {}\", info));\n    }));\n}\n\nThe Fatal error type has a side-effect of failing any running transaction, and closing the connection to the DB. In my testing, if we panicked without a handler, it would cause Postgres to kill the entire DB process, restart and recover. This would be undesirable to say the least, thus the panic handler. Let's look at pg_error::log function, because it was really annoying:\nHow to easily lose 3 days of development time\nEverything in building this library was fairly straightforward up to this point, and just worked. Which was a great feeling. Then while trying to call the log routines in Postgres, I nearly gave up. It was the first case where I was attempting to call Postgres APIs from the Rust, rather than the other direction, and I couldn't get it to link, here's the code:\n// The log method implicitly needs to allocate a C style string. I'm not super happy with this\n//    interface as it doesn't allow a caller to just pass in a `Cstr` directly, so this will\n//    change in the future. Also, `file` and `func_name` will be `&amp;'static str` in almost all\n//    cases, so we'll probably change this back to that.\npub fn log&lt;T1, T2, T3&gt;(level: Level, file: T1, line: u32, func_name: T2, msg: T3)\nwhere\n    T1: Into&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;,\n    T2: Into&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;,\n    T3: Into&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;,\n{\n    use std::ffi::CString;\n\n    // convert to C ffi, we need to allocate on conversion from Rust strings to C strings, due to\n    //    the fact that they are stored differently. i.e. Rust stores the length of the string,\n    //    whereas C is null terminated.\n    let file = CString::new(file.into()).expect(\"this should not fail: file\");\n    let line = line as c_int;\n    let func_name = CString::new(func_name.into()).expect(\"this should not fail: func_name\");\n    let msg = CString::new(msg.into()).expect(\"this should not fail: msg\");\n\n    // now we perform the conversions as required by the FFI interfaces.\n    let file: *const c_char = file.as_ptr();\n    let func_name: *const c_char = func_name.as_ptr();\n    let msg: *const c_char = msg.as_ptr();\n\n    let errlevel: c_int = c_int::from(level);\n\n    // log the data:\n    unsafe {\n        // I don't know the reasoning behind these interfaces in Postgres, but I was able to unwrap\n        //    these from the standard `ereport` macro in the Postgres headers. `errstart`, `errmsg`,\n        //    and `errfinish` are calls into Postgres from this library.\n        if pg_sys::errstart(errlevel, file, line, func_name, ERR_DOMAIN.as_ptr() as *const c_char) {\n            let msg_result = pg_sys::errmsg(msg);\n            pg_sys::errfinish(msg_result);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis all works now, but it took me a while to get it to build. The reason was Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64! I tried everything to get this to link. I tried linking against every dylib (I'm on macOS) and .a in the brew installed version of Postgres, searched them all with nm. Then I built Postgres from scratch and scoured every built artifact again with nm to find the what I should link against, statically or dynamically, for those symbols. I almost gave up, but then came across this answer on stackoverflow for building postgres extensions with cgo. And then I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out how pass similar flags to the Rust compiler, and here's the answer:\n$&gt; RUSTFLAGS=\"-C link-arg=-undefineddynamic_lookup\" cargo build\n   Compiling pg-extend v0.2.0 (${PATH_TO_LIBRARY}/pg-extend-rs/pg-extend)\n   Compiling add-one v0.1.0 (${PATH_TO_LIBRARY}/pg-extend-rs/examples/add_one)\n   Finished release [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 8.89s\n\nThe relief of something finally building after beating your head against that virtual wall behind the computer screen is the greatest of gifts. It let's you finally sleep and stop considering all the possible things you haven't tried yet to fix the problem.\nFrom the docs, here's what that argument does to ld in the llvm tools: Specifies how undefined symbols are to be treated. Options are: error, warning, suppress, or dynamic_lookup.  The default is error.\nNow, one last thing, the allocators.\nProperly allocating memory in Postgres\nPostgres has it's own allocator, palloc, as well as an associated pfree. All memory allocated with palloc is guaranteed to be deallocated when a transaction and/or connection are closed. This is a nice feature for not leaking memory. Somewhat recently, Rust stabilized overriding the global allocator. This was the line in the pg_magic macro that was annotated with #[global_allocator]. The allocator implementation is straight forward, but I have some open questions about whether or not it's correct, here it is:\npub struct PgAllocator;\n\nunsafe impl GlobalAlloc for PgAllocator {\n    unsafe fn alloc(&amp;self, layout: Layout) -&gt; *mut u8 {\n        // TODO: is there anything we need ot do in terms of layout, etc?\n        pg_sys::palloc(layout.size()) as *mut u8\n    }\n\n    unsafe fn dealloc(&amp;self, ptr: *mut u8, _layout: Layout) {\n        pg_sys::pfree(ptr as *mut c_void)\n    }\n}\n\nIt's pretty simple (also requires the RUSTFLAG linker setting), it just calls into the Postgres allocator. You'll notice the TODO there as I'm unclear what to do about alignment or other layout issues.\nLoad the extension in Posrgres\nConnect to the DB and load the function (your DB connection probably differs):\n$&gt; psql postgres\npsql (11.1)\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=# CREATE FUNCTION add_one(integer) RETURNS integer AS '${PATH_TO_LIBRARY}/pg-extend-rs/target/release/libadd_one.dylib', 'pg_add_one' LANGUAGE C STRICT;\nCREATE FUNCTION\npostgres=# SELECT add_one(3);\n add_one\n---------\n       4\n(1 row)\n\npostgres=# \\q\n\nNotice that the symbol to load is pg_add_one and not add_one, as the latter would have conflicted with the original function in Rust. As a future task, I want to build generators for the psql scripts to load the function\nJust the beginning\nThis is really just the beginning of this library. There is going to be a long road to complete it, as there are a lot of type conversions to implement for the PgDatum type. As I have time, I will get to it, but if you find this useful and want to contribute, please feel welcome. I've picked as open a set of licenses as possible to allow people from all walks to get in on the fun, bluejekyll/pg-extend-rs.\nAs always, thank you to all the Rust contributors who continue to make the language an absolute pleasure.\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/announcing-pg-extend/","title":"Easy Postgres extensions in Rust with pg-extend-rs"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/await-trust-dns/":{"body":"What started as a brief sojourn to learn the new std::future::Future in Rust 1.36, slowly became a journey to fully adopt the new async/await syntax in Rust. The plan had been to merely update to the new Future API, trying to keep the minimum Rust version as low as possible. This was ideally to keep the libraries compatible with more Rust users, but it became apparent that this wasn't really feasible. For a number of reasons, primarily, all of the underlying libraries Trust-DNS relies upon were moving in this direction, which made the task a fools errand. Additionally, adopting async/await simplified much of the code. This post is the announcement of the 0.18 release, representing a few months of work.\nAdopting async/await\nAsync/await has been a long awaited feature in Rust. It's such a massive game changer for the language. Low level async programming has traditionally always meant building state machines and abstracting the workflow of the system around them. The original version of Futures in Rust were no different, though the Futures library did help substantially by giving us predefined state machines for common scenarios.\nIt can be most easily shown how much more ergonomic this is from some code, here's an example from the previous release of Trust-DNS, the HTTPS request handler:\npub fn h2_handler&lt;T, I&gt;(\n    handler: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;,\n    io: I,\n    src_addr: SocketAddr,\n    dns_hostname: Arc&lt;String&gt;,\n) -&gt; impl Future&lt;Item = (), Error = ()&gt;\nwhere\n    T: RequestHandler,\n    I: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite,\n{\n    // Start the HTTP/2.0 connection handshake\n    server::handshake(io)\n        .map_err(|e| warn!(\"h2 handshake error: {}\", e))\n        .and_then(move |h2| {\n            let dns_hostname = dns_hostname.clone();\n            // Accept all inbound HTTP/2.0 streams sent over the\n            // connection.\n            h2.map_err(|e| warn!(\"h2 failed to receive message: {}\", e))\n                .for_each(move |(request, respond)| {\n                    debug!(\"Received request: {:#?}\", request);\n                    let dns_hostname = dns_hostname.clone();\n                    let handler = handler.clone();\n                    let responder = HttpsResponseHandle(Arc::new(Mutex::new(respond)));\n\n                    https_server::message_from(dns_hostname, request)\n                        .map_err(|e| warn!(\"h2 failed to receive message: {}\", e))\n                        .and_then(|bytes| {\n                            BinDecodable::from_bytes(&amp;bytes)\n                                .map_err(|e| warn!(\"could not decode message: {}\", e))\n                        })\n                        .and_then(move |message| {\n                            debug!(\"received message: {:?}\", message);\n\n                            server_future::handle_request(\n                                message,\n                                src_addr,\n                                handler.clone(),\n                                responder,\n                            )\n                        })\n                })\n        })\n        .map_err(|_| warn!(\"error in h2 handler\"))\n}\n\nThis example shows how the older Future combinators could be used together, but it made for somewhat complex code to write. The async fn version is much more straightforward:\npub async fn h2_handler&lt;T, I&gt;(\n    handler: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;,\n    io: I,\n    src_addr: SocketAddr,\n    dns_hostname: Arc&lt;String&gt;,\n) where\n    T: RequestHandler,\n    I: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin,\n{\n    let dns_hostname = dns_hostname.clone();\n\n    // Start the HTTP/2.0 connection handshake\n    let mut h2 = match server::handshake(io).await {\n        Ok(h2) =&gt; h2,\n        Err(err) =&gt; {\n            warn!(\"handshake error from {}: {}\", src_addr, err);\n            return;\n        }\n    };\n\n    // Accept all inbound HTTP/2.0 streams sent over the\n    // connection.\n    while let Some(next_request) = h2.accept().await {\n        let (request, respond) = match next_request {\n            Ok(next_request) =&gt; next_request,\n            Err(err) =&gt; {\n                warn!(\"error accepting request {}: {}\", src_addr, err);\n                return;\n            }\n        };\n\n        debug!(\"Received request: {:#?}\", request);\n        let dns_hostname = dns_hostname.clone();\n        let handler = handler.clone();\n        let responder = HttpsResponseHandle(Arc::new(Mutex::new(respond)));\n\n        match https_server::message_from(dns_hostname, request).await {\n            Ok(bytes) =&gt; handle_request(bytes, src_addr, handler, responder).await,\n            Err(err) =&gt; warn!(\"error while handling request from {}: {}\", src_addr, err),\n        };\n\n        // we'll continue handling requests from here.\n    }\n}\n\nYou'll notice that this code is much more straight forward and easier to read, flatter if you will. This is the big advantage of async/await, you can write code in a much simpler manner.\nTrust-DNS still has hand made State Machines\nTrust-DNS has grown to 65 kloc with 41 kloc when excluding documentation (and there are still features to develop). Much of this has been in use for the past 4 years–rewriting it all to be async/await will take time, and isn't necessary to provide a new async/await API for the Resolver or other libraries. If you browse the code, this will be noticeable throughout. There are also some other reasons for keeping the hand made Futures, this is the fact that the Futures returned by an async fn is really just and impl trait. This signature:\nasync fn foo() -&gt; Bar {...}\n\nis for all intents and purposes equivalent to\nfn foo() -&gt; impl Future&lt;Output = Bar&gt; {...}\n\nmeaning that all the same limitations on usage of impl Future apply to the result of the async fn. One of those is that impl traits can not be named, e.g. it can't be stored as a field in a struct. This is easily worked around, as the type can just be boxed, and used as a dyn object, e.g. Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output = Bar&gt;&gt;. Alternatively, you can implement the Future yourself, and avoid the boxing. So there are still some potential advantages by not adopting async fns everywhere, but those are rare.\nThe ecosystem continues to advance\nTrust-DNS has in many ways grown with the ecosystem around it. Initially it was built around the stdlib blocking IO apis. Once that POC was done, it was converted to use non-blocking IO with mio. After that as Tokio and Futures were developed in tandem, Trust-DNS adopted them early on and benefited greatly from those advancements. Now, Tokio and Futures have both been upgraded to also have async/await APIs, and they've become far easier to use because of it. It really is a great time to explore async IO in Rust. We know that people are excited, because the minute that the Trust-DNS Resolver supported Tokio 0.2 in 0.18.0.alpha.2, we saw a huge spike in downloads.\nOddly enough, a feature of the Trust-DNS Resolver to make testing easier will also potentially make it easy to port other executors (like async-std). To facilitate decent tests in the resolver a trait was defined, ConnectionProvider. This trait allowed for the creation of mocked connections to test all the Resolver's logic, allowing us to test many different scenarios without actually introducing any network IO. This has the interesting side-effect of being useful for abstracting the underlying executor and network drivers–something for us to explore in the future.\nTokio itself has improved in a lot of other ways as well. The library has been polished significantly. There were some nuances to learn in adapting all of Trust-DNS to it, but all very much worth it. Please, explore the new API and I'd love any feedback you'd like to provide: Trust-DNS Resolver, discussion can be had on the release note on the users.rust-lang.org discussion board.\nA Massive thank you!\nI want to thank Lucio @lucio_d_franco and Eliza @mycoliza for helping review so much of this. Additionally, I'd like to express my thanks to everyone who's contributed to Rust's async/await features, which are a spectacular achievement. To everyone who's contributed to Futures and Tokio, that was a herculean effort and it's really paid off, thank you! To all of the folks that continue to experiment with and contribute to Trust-DNS, this would not be possible without you. Lastly, thank you, Carl @carllerche for convincing me to \"ship and fix later\".\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/await-trust-dns/","title":"Await Trust-DNS no longer"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/branchless-rust/":{"body":"Recently there were two new issues discovered with CPUs, Meltdown (Intel) and Spectre (all \"fast\" CPUs?). Both of which basically exploit speculative branch prediction to gain access to memory via what's known as a side-channel attack. There was a Webkit response to this in which they mention they will start utilizing \"Branchless Security Checks\". A request was put out for the Rust community's aspirations of the language in 2018, this post is in that spirit. For me, I would love to see the language continue its explosive growth. Branchless code is potentially an accelerant toward that end.\nThe Branchless Opportunity\nIn Rust it is possible to use generics as a means to write branchless code. It's not the only language that can do this, any language with monomorphization (C++) is capable of this. Here's an example of code from the domain Name type in TRust-DNS that I've recently rewritten to be branchless:\n    pub fn cmp_with_case(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self, ignore_case: bool) -&gt; Ordering {\n        if self.labels.is_empty() &amp;&amp; other.labels.is_empty() {\n            return Ordering::Equal;\n        }\n\n        // we reverse the iters so that we are comparing from the root/domain to the local...\n        let self_labels = self.labels.iter().rev();\n        let other_labels = other.labels.iter().rev();\n\n        for (l, r) in self_labels.zip(other_labels) {\n///             | | | |\n/// LOOK HERE  | | | | The branch we'll remove\n///           V V V V\n            if ignore_case {\n                match (*l).to_lowercase().cmp(&amp;(*r).to_lowercase()) {\n                    o @ Ordering::Less | o @ Ordering::Greater =&gt; return o,\n                    Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                }\n            } else {\n                match l.cmp(r) {\n                    o @ Ordering::Less | o @ Ordering::Greater =&gt; return o,\n                    Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        self.labels.len().cmp(&amp;other.labels.len())\n    }\n\nThis is the new code is now split across two objects, Name and Label. It now uses a generic to perform the comparison:\n/// From Name\n    pub fn cmp_with_f&lt;F: LabelCmp&gt;(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Ordering {\n        if self.labels.is_empty() &amp;&amp; other.labels.is_empty() {\n            return Ordering::Equal;\n        }\n\n        // we reverse the iters so that we are comparing from the root/domain to the local...\n        let self_labels = self.labels.iter().rev();\n        let other_labels = other.labels.iter().rev();\n\n        for (l, r) in self_labels.zip(other_labels) {\n///             | | | |\n/// LOOK HERE  | | | | No branch the &lt;F&gt; is a type parameter instead\n///           V V V V\n            match l.cmp_with_f::&lt;F&gt;(r) {\n                Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                not_eq =&gt; return not_eq,\n            }\n        }\n\n        self.labels.len().cmp(&amp;other.labels.len())\n    }\n\n\n/// From Label, this is the is where the type comes into play\n    pub fn cmp_with_f&lt;F: LabelCmp&gt;(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Ordering {\n        let s = self.0.iter();\n        let o = other.0.iter();\n\n        for (s, o) in s.zip(o) {\n///             | | | |\n/// LOOK HERE  | | | | No branch for the comparison (the match is for the result of the comparison)\n///           V V V V\n            match F::cmp_u8(*s, *o) {\n                Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                not_eq =&gt; return not_eq,\n            }\n        }\n\n        self.0.len().cmp(&amp;other.0.len())\n    }\n\n/// And here are the comparison types:\n\n/// Label comparison trait for case sensitive or insensitive comparisons\npub trait LabelCmp {\n    /// this should mimic the cmp method from [`PartialOrd`]\n    fn cmp_u8(l: u8, r: u8) -&gt; Ordering;\n}\n\n/// For case sensitive comparisons\npub struct CaseSensitive;\n\nimpl LabelCmp for CaseSensitive {\n    fn cmp_u8(l: u8, r: u8) -&gt; Ordering {\n        l.cmp(&amp;r)\n    }\n}\n\n/// For case insensitive comparisons\npub struct CaseInsensitive;\n\nimpl LabelCmp for CaseInsensitive {\n    fn cmp_u8(l: u8, r: u8) -&gt; Ordering {\n        l.to_ascii_lowercase().cmp(&amp;r.to_ascii_lowercase())\n    }\n}\n\nTo make calling these easier I have two standard methods defined:\n    /// Case sensitive comparison\n    pub fn cmp_case(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Ordering {\n        self.cmp_with_f::&lt;CaseSensitive&gt;(other)\n    }\n\n    /// Case insensitive comparison\n    fn cmp(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Ordering {\n        self.cmp_with_f::&lt;CaseInsensitive&gt;(other)\n    }\n\nI did this to reduce errors around passing the wrong boolean parameter to the compare function. The point is that this is branchless. Here's another recent post from @RReverser, \"Conditional enum variants in Rust\", while not explicitly about branchless programming, it's a similar usage of type parameters as a means improve the code.\nThings could be better\nIf const generics are implemented, I think we could change the case comparison logic to this:\n    pub fn cmp_with&lt;const CASE: bool&gt;(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Ordering {\n        let s = self.0.iter();\n        let o = other.0.iter();\n\n        for (s, o) in s.zip(o) {\n///             | | | |\n/// LOOK HERE  | | | | This branch will be optimized out by the compiler b/c it's a const bool\n///           V V V V\n            let (s, o) = if CASE {\n                (s, o)\n            } else {\n                (s.to_lowercase(), o.to_lowercase())\n            };\n\n            match s::cmp(o) {\n                Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                not_eq =&gt; return not_eq,\n            }\n        }\n\n        self.0.len().cmp(&amp;other.0.len())\n    }\n\nThis requires that the compiler optimizes out the constant boolean dictated through the const generic. It's less code than the technique I used before, though possibly not as obvious that it's branchless. That's of course due to the fact that it's the compiler that would optimize out the branch for the case comparison. This of course is not necessary for branchless programming in Rust, but it might be more approachable.\nExcuse me, Ben\nI just wanted to point out that your code is not actually branchless, you're currently thinking, and you're right! All those match statements and the for loops are branches. Of which I am aware, but if you go back and read the Webkit article, perhaps you can see where type parameters could be used to make that style of programming easier.\nThanks!\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/branchless-rust/","title":"Branchless #Rust2018"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/making-trust-dns-fast/":{"body":"When I wrote Taking TRust-DNS IntoFuture regarding the initial implementation of TRust-DNS over the Tokio async library, one of the first questions I was asked (by one of the maintainers): \"is it the fastest implementation out there?\" Sadly the answer was no, not by a long shot. TRust-DNS was 400µs and BIND9 100µs (as measured on my getting older laptop, YMMV). 300µs is a miniscule amount of time to people, but to computers that's a lot of time. Given that inside datacenters a full round trip is 500µs, spending an extra 300µs on the node serving up the IP address of the service you're trying to connect to is not insubstantial. Shouldn't we be able to beat BIND? Of course we should. The rest of this post is going to document the path to get there, and some that I tried but didn't follow. As my knowledge of Rust has grown, it seemed like a good time to try some new things. It's an arbitrary goal, but it's a fun one.\nMeasure First, Cut Second\nWhere are we right now? Well, after starting to use better practices around references and clones in the project, this number is down to 250µs. Why did this improve so much from the 400µs? I really have no idea. It could be improvements in the compiler and such, but that would surprise me if it made that big of a difference. My guess is that after writing that previous post and being disappointed in the performance, I started practicing better code style around not cloning data and better utilizing reference passing, etc. Our target is being set by BIND9's performance[1]:\ntest bind_udp_bench           ... bench:      69,960 ns/iter (+/- 7,207)\n\n69µs, that's the number we need to beat (best time produced after multiple runs of the benchmark test, due to network stack, etc. this has not always produced a consistent number).\nI have some theories on where I should spend my time in trying to speed things up. My guess is that for the records stored in the authority, they are not stored in serialized form. This means that the records are always serialized for each response. If we pre-serialize I think this should get us the biggest win. The next is that buffers are allocated on each request. My guess is that if this is replaced with a fixed-sized pool of buffers, like an arena. The next thing I'm going to guess is that for each set of records we return, there is a new Vec&lt;&amp;Record&gt; returned. Getting rid of this might speed things up. I want to play with some ideas around chained iterators instead of creating the temporary Vecs. Some other ideas are to go through and replace a lot of the Box&lt;Future&lt;...&gt;&gt; results from a lot of methods throughout the library. But which should we target first? There are a million good quotes on this, but I like this one: \"Human beings, even experienced programmers, are very poor at predicting (guessing) where a computation will bog down.\" from C2. So I've made my guesses, but given that I'm human, we should find a way to get the machine to tell us if we're correct.\nI liked this post about optimizing Rust from jFransham. Lots of good advice in there, and it links to this great post: Rust Performance: A story featuring perf and flamegraph on Linux, but that's Linux, my dev machine in macOS. So we'll be using Carol Nicol's, Rust Profiling with Instruments and FlameGraph on OSX: CPU/Time. I was concerned that switching to the system allocator, as she recommends in that article, would have an effect on the benchmark. If it does, it's not one that showed up in my testing.\nFollowing Carol's instructions, I launched Instruments and registered the named binary from TRust-DNS. Configured with the same options I was using in the bench tests, it was ready to go. I just needed to pick a stable UDP port to use. Back to the bench test itself with a hard-coded port and stopped launching named in the test. After I ran the test, I was going to be excited to see all of this profile information to tell me where to fix things. I ran the test and:\ntest trust_dns_udp_bench ... bench:     100,892 ns/iter (+/- 148,959)\n\nwait... hold on a second here, 100µs? This was definitely not expected. TRust-DNS is almost as fast as BIND9. So I reviewed the startup, initially thinking it was the Stdio::piped arg for stdout on the Command. It was not that, but the answer does lie in the initialization:\n    let mut named = Command::new(&amp;format!(\"{}/../target/debug/named\", server_path))\n        .stdout(Stdio::null())\n        .arg(&amp;format!(\n            \"--config={}/tests/named_test_configs/example.toml\",\n            server_path\n        ))\n        .arg(&amp;format!(\n            \"--zonedir={}/tests/named_test_configs\",\n            server_path\n        ))\n        .arg(&amp;format!(\"--port={}\", test_port))\n        .spawn()\n        .expect(\"failed to start named\");\n\nTake a look at the path to the TRust-DNS command, \"{}/../target/debug/named\", notice debug? Yup... making that release means that we're using the optimized target. Let's see what the time is with the fixed version:\ntest trust_dns_udp_bench      ... bench:      79,274 ns/iter (+/- 9,626)\n\nThat's significantly better, and brings us within 10µs of BIND9. That was a sad oversight; I've been underselling TRust-DNS' performance for over a year.\nCollecting Some Data\nNow that we're viewing the correct binary, we can actually start looking at how to make it faster. Here's a screenshot of the Instruments capture, which has a lot of options. I've narrowed the view to only the time where the test was running.\n\nI've underlined some things to draw your attention to them. You'll notice a few things. First on the left is the time spent in different calls. There are some that I avoided in this view. For example, the time spent in I/O. Most of the time is actually spent in UdpSocket::recv_from and UdpSocket::send_to, which we expect, this is mainly a network bound process after all. The other time I'm ignoring is the time spent in env_logger, as I see logging as important for monitoring the process.\nSo what does that leave for us? Looking at that image, on the right is the tool helpfully drawing your attention to the most expensive call stack in the capture. Following through from the left, most of the expense in the call is in the lookup of the record from the Authority. You'll notice in the underlined calls that we recorded, Catalog::lookup eventually ends up relying on Name::cmp_with_case. I've only shown a snippet, but the call into this function happens a lot. It's not surprising, during a lookup the Query::name is one of the three components we're using for the search, and it's the most complex. Names are the human interface into DNS (arguably it's most important feature), and for better or worse, they are generally case-insensitive. On the good side this means that someone typing WWW.GOOGLE.COM into their browser, will get the same result as if they type www.google.com; on the bad side it means that we have to do a more complex string comparison where we convert to lowercase while comparing during our search for records in the Authority (I'll be referring to other findings from the instruments tool throughout this post). I wonder if this is a regret on the side of the original RFC authors? [2]\nLet's look at this function:\n    pub fn cmp_with_case(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self, ignore_case: bool) -&gt; Ordering {\n        if self.labels.is_empty() &amp;&amp; other.labels.is_empty() {\n            return Ordering::Equal;\n        }\n\n        // we reverse the iters so that we are comparing from the root/domain to the local...\n        let self_labels = self.labels.iter().rev();\n        let other_labels = other.labels.iter().rev();\n\n        // here were taking all the labels from the name\n        for (l, r) in self_labels.zip(other_labels) {\n            if ignore_case {\n                // for each we to_lowercase, hey, this allocates a new String each time!\n                match (*l).to_lowercase().cmp(&amp;(*r).to_lowercase()) {\n                    o @ Ordering::Less | o @ Ordering::Greater =&gt; return o,\n                    Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                }\n            } else {\n                match l.cmp(r) {\n                    o @ Ordering::Less | o @ Ordering::Greater =&gt; return o,\n                    Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        self.labels.len().cmp(&amp;other.labels.len())\n    }\n\nThe to_lowercase is occurring on each label portion of the name, and if you look at the docs for String::to_lowercase, this allocates a new String. This post recently made the rounds, Fast software is a discipline, not a purpose, what's the very first bullet point? \"Avoid unnecessary memory allocations\" and then the next one, \"Avoid multiple passes over the data when one would do\". By performing the to_lowercase while evaluating all names, we are basically breaking both of these rules. Well, let's see if we can fix that.\nI created 3 variations for comparing names:\n\n\nshort\n\"com\" == \"COM\" // case insensitive\n\"com\" != \"COM\" // case sensitive\n\"com\" == \"com\" // case sensitive\n\n\nmedium, about average length\n\"www.example.com\" == \"www.EXAMPLE.com\" // case insensitive\n\"www.example.com\" != \"www.EXAMPLE.com\" // case sensitive\n\"www.example.com\" == \"www.example.com\" // case sensitive\n\n\nlong\n\"a.crazy.really.long.example.com\" == \"a.crazy.really.long.EXAMPLE.com\" // case insensitive\n\"a.crazy.really.long.example.com\" != \"a.crazy.really.long.EXAMPLE.com\" // case sensitive\n\"a.crazy.really.long.example.com\" == \"a.crazy.really.long.example.com\" // case sensitive\n\n\nHere are the runtimes:\nrunning 9 tests\ntest name_cmp_long          ... bench:       2,178 ns/iter (+/- 387)\ntest name_cmp_long_case     ... bench:          33 ns/iter (+/- 9)\ntest name_cmp_long_not_eq   ... bench:          11 ns/iter (+/- 2)\ntest name_cmp_medium        ... bench:       1,052 ns/iter (+/- 196)\ntest name_cmp_medium_case   ... bench:          18 ns/iter (+/- 4)\ntest name_cmp_medium_not_eq ... bench:          10 ns/iter (+/- 3)\ntest name_cmp_short         ... bench:         255 ns/iter (+/- 86)\ntest name_cmp_short_case    ... bench:           8 ns/iter (+/- 5)\ntest name_cmp_short_not_eq  ... bench:           6 ns/iter (+/- 1) \n\nThose case insensitive checks are really expensive! What are our options here? I see two options: make the comparison itself not allocate new Strings - this would be easier; Make a new type of Name like LowerName or such - this would be harder. The latter would require a lot more effort in terms of refactor call sites in the library, and I'd prefer to try and keep these changes performant, but maintain some simplicity in the code. So we'll try option 1 first, the code isn't all that different. The change is in the for loop from above, we just add an inner loop on chars:\n        for (l, r) in self_labels.zip(other_labels) {\n            if ignore_case {\n                // just grab the chars, and then do the lower case setting:\n                for (l, r) in l.chars().zip(r.chars()) {\n                    match l.to_lowercase().cmp(r.to_lowercase()) {\n                        o @ Ordering::Less | o @ Ordering::Greater =&gt; return o,\n                        Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                match l.cmp(r) {\n                    o @ Ordering::Less | o @ Ordering::Greater =&gt; return o,\n                    Ordering::Equal =&gt; continue,\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nAnd the new timings:\nrunning 9 tests\ntest name_cmp_long          ... bench:       1,332 ns/iter (+/- 273)\ntest name_cmp_long_case     ... bench:          31 ns/iter (+/- 7)\ntest name_cmp_long_not_eq   ... bench:          10 ns/iter (+/- 2)\ntest name_cmp_medium        ... bench:         686 ns/iter (+/- 355)\ntest name_cmp_medium_case   ... bench:          18 ns/iter (+/- 8)\ntest name_cmp_medium_not_eq ... bench:          10 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest name_cmp_short         ... bench:         157 ns/iter (+/- 5)\ntest name_cmp_short_case    ... bench:           8 ns/iter (+/- 3)\ntest name_cmp_short_not_eq  ... bench:           6 ns/iter (+/- 3)\n\nThat's better, we've almost doubled the speed. After running this attempt through our benchmark it made no difference to the overall time. Ok, slightly more extreme variation, let's store a lowercased version of the labels internally in Name on demand. I've added an extra field to Name with all the labels lowercased, and to simplify the object changed the labels from Vec&lt;Arc&lt;String&gt;&gt; to just Vec&lt;String&gt;. This is a little ugly, something I can go back and cleanup:\npub struct Name {\n    is_fqdn: bool,\n    labels: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n    // Now it's stored separately\n    lower_case_labels: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n}\n\nThe reason I think that's ugly is that we now have an entire class of potential bugs related to it. When adding a label, we need to add it to both, same with removing. Luckily there were a lot of unit tests covering Name, so the likely hood of missing simple issues here is low, but still. Here are the new times:\nrunning 9 tests\ntest name_cmp_long          ... bench:          30 ns/iter (+/- 4)\ntest name_cmp_long_case     ... bench:          29 ns/iter (+/- 2)\ntest name_cmp_long_not_eq   ... bench:          10 ns/iter (+/- 2)\ntest name_cmp_medium        ... bench:          16 ns/iter (+/- 2)\ntest name_cmp_medium_case   ... bench:          16 ns/iter (+/- 6)\ntest name_cmp_medium_not_eq ... bench:           9 ns/iter (+/- 1)\ntest name_cmp_short         ... bench:           7 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest name_cmp_short_case    ... bench:           7 ns/iter (+/- 1)\ntest name_cmp_short_not_eq  ... bench:           6 ns/iter (+/- 1)\n\nNow that is much better! Again, after running the overall benchmark, we didn't see a difference. Maybe by removing Arc from the labels, we have too many clones of Name now? Time to throw it into the profiler again... (time passes) ...after perusing the profiler output, there were still a lot of to_lowercase calls showing up. But even with that change, it's made no difference to the overall benchmark.\nRevisiting String Duplication (1 Month Later)\nAfter reaching the end of this expedition (continue reading), I came back and decided to revisit the hack that I put in place above, specifically the duplicate Strings. So I reverted the changes to name, so that we can take a different approach. I thought it would be fun to see if to_lowercase on Name could be faster if we performed the  lowercase operation when needed, otherwise just a simple clone of the Arc to each label would suffice. I wrote some benchmarks to start (the no means that there is no difference between the lowercased form and the non-lowercased form):\ntest name_no_lower_long     ... bench:         699 ns/iter (+/- 29)\ntest name_no_lower_short    ... bench:         242 ns/iter (+/- 34)\ntest name_to_lower_long     ... bench:         705 ns/iter (+/- 33)\ntest name_to_lower_short    ... bench:         229 ns/iter (+/- 52)\n\nAnd then after only to_lowercasing the label if it's required (code follows):\ntest name_no_lower_long     ... bench:          69 ns/iter (+/- 32)\ntest name_no_lower_short    ... bench:          36 ns/iter (+/- 17)\ntest name_to_lower_long     ... bench:         340 ns/iter (+/- 98)\ntest name_to_lower_short    ... bench:         188 ns/iter (+/- 69)\n\nThat's a nice improvement, so I'll keep the code:\n    pub fn to_lowercase(&amp;self) -&gt; Self {\n        let mut new_labels: Vec&lt;Rc&lt;String&gt;&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(self.labels.len());\n        for label in &amp;self.labels {\n            if label.chars().any(|c| !c.is_lowercase()) {\n                new_labels.push(Rc::new(label.to_lowercase()));\n            } else {\n                new_labels.push(Rc::clone(label))\n            }\n        }\n\n        Name{ is_fqdn: self.is_fqdn, labels: new_labels }\n    }\n\nBut, when searching for matches, and storing the Keys in the Authority we don't care about case at all... So I created a LowerName, that guarantees that the Name is already lowercased where we need it to be:\n# comparison\ntest name_cmp_long        ... bench:          35 ns/iter (+/- 11)\ntest name_cmp_long_case   ... bench:          35 ns/iter (+/- 5)\ntest name_cmp_medium      ... bench:          19 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest name_cmp_medium_case ... bench:          19 ns/iter (+/- 1)\ntest name_cmp_short       ... bench:           8 ns/iter (+/- 1)\ntest name_cmp_short_case  ... bench:           8 ns/iter (+/- 0)\n\n# to_lowercase\ntest name_no_lower_long   ... bench:           2 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest name_no_lower_medium ... bench:           2 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest name_no_lower_short  ... bench:           2 ns/iter (+/- 1)\ntest name_to_lower_long   ... bench:           2 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest name_to_lower_medium ... bench:           2 ns/iter (+/- 0)\ntest name_to_lower_short  ... bench:           2 ns/iter (+/- 0)\n\nThe to_lowercase section is a joke. The name is already lowercased (and type safe at that). It's just doing a stupid check to make sure the benchmark isn't removed entirely. I won't be adding this useless benchmark. Obviously, I'm not really expecting a better result than the former case of compares that were case sensitive, but this makes sure that all cases of to_lowercase are verifiably not needed because of the new LowerName type. In addition to that, I've created a LowerQuery which is just a wrapper around LowerName, DNSClass, and RecordType then used that as the type of the parameter for the API into the Catalog and Authority. We still have a flexible programming environment when working with these structures.\nDon't Have a Cow\nOk, truth be known, I really wanted to use Cow for all of this. Cow is our friend, and this String method in particular:\nfn from_utf8_lossy(v: &amp;'a [u8]) -&gt; Cow&lt;'a, str&gt; {...}\n\nThere is a concern here, which is that this lossy method will result in non-valid utf8 characters being converted to �. This seems like an acceptable loss for now. It's not incorrect per sé. Obviously the other option here would be to just directly use [u8], but that would mean we'd lose access to Rust's nice to_lowercase, and why would we want to do that?\nSo I had created a new Name type, DecodedName&lt;'r&gt; which shared a lifetime with the request buffer backing the BinDecoder&lt;'r&gt;. This meant that if the buffer was proper utf8 and in addition lowercase, we wouldn't have needed to allocate anything for query names. But I ran into an issue: all of the RecordSets are stored in a BTreeMap keyed off of RrKey which is just a wrapper type of Name and RecordType. BTree::get has this interface:\nfn get&lt;Q&gt;(&amp;self, key: &amp;Q) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;V&gt; where\n    K: Borrow&lt;Q&gt;,\n    Q: Ord + ?Sized, \n\nI could not for the life of me figure out how get a Name implement a Borrow&lt;Q&gt; where Q would have been DecodeName&lt;'r&gt; (or RrKey to DecodedRrKey&lt;'r&gt; which is what would have been needed). After working through a lot of ideas, I gave up on this approach. Maybe there's a way to do it with unsafe and std::mem::transmute, but I'm trying to keep all unsafe usage out of the TRust-DNS libraries (and have been successful up to this point). So I leave that as a challenge to someone who knows Rust better than I.\nSurprises Lurking in Old Code\nThe next thing on this list is the serialization. It turns out half our time in the RequestHandler is spent serializing and for the big ticket item, serialization of the Records:\n374.2ms   19.8%\t624   19.5%\t2.5\t \t    _$LT$trust_dns_server..server..server_future..ServerFuture::handle_request\n148.7ms    7.8%\t237    7.4%\t5.7\t \t       trust_dns_server::server::request_stream::ResponseHandle::send\n...\n57.9ms    3.0%\t95    2.9%\t6.0\t \t         _$LT$trust_dns_proto..rr..resource..Record::emit\n29.5ms    1.5%\t48    1.5%\t0.6\t \t          trust_dns_proto::rr::record_data::RData::emit\n...\n14.9ms    0.7%\t23    0.7%\t2.4\t \t         _$LT$trust_dns_proto..rr..resource..Record::clone\n\nThe last one surprised me, though, I spent a lot of time making sure that references were passed to individual records stored in the Authority. Turns out, in some of the original code, I had been lazy and had delayed making a borrowed version of Message. This means all the records inserted into the response Message ended up being cloned. It's not the most substantial cost of the send, but it's ugly in Catalog::lookup:\n    pub fn lookup(&amp;self, request: &amp;Message) -&gt; Message {\n        let mut response: Message = Message::new();\n        // ...\n        // CLONE!!\n        // ...\n        response.add_queries(request.queries().into_iter().cloned());\n\n        // ...\n        for query in request.queries() {\n            if let Some(ref_authority) = self.find_auth_recurse(query.name()) {\n\n                let records = authority.search(query, is_dnssec, supported_algorithms);\n                if !records.is_empty() {\n                    response.set_response_code(ResponseCode::NoError);\n                    response.set_authoritative(true);\n\n                    // ...\n                    // CLONE!!\n                    // ...\n                    response.add_answers(records.iter().cloned());\n                    // ...\n                }\n                // ...\n            }\n          // ...\n        }\n\n        // ...\n    }\n\nMessage was one of the first things written in the library, I had not yet become as comfortable with the type system in the language enough to understand[3] the patterns for writing generics over owned and unowned data in Rust. But now, I get to clean this 💩 up. By introducing a new Message type, MessageResponse, there is now a zero (less) copy Message type:\npub struct MessageResponse&lt;'q, 'a&gt; {\n    header: Header,\n    queries: Option&lt;&amp;'q Queries&lt;'q&gt;&gt;,\n    answers: Vec&lt;&amp;'a Record&gt;,\n    name_servers: Vec&lt;&amp;'a Record&gt;,\n    additionals: Vec&lt;&amp;'a Record&gt;,\n    sig0: Vec&lt;Record&gt;,\n    edns: Option&lt;Edns&gt;,\n}\n\nThis MessageResponse type only has strong ownership of the data it requires, things like sig0 and EDNS, which are dynamically constructed per request. Notice this has two lifetimes (Message did not have any), 'q and 'a. 'q represents the request lifetime of Queries&lt;'q&gt; which itself is a new type for this change. Queries&lt;'q&gt; carry a reference to the request buffer's query section, which is now used to stream those directly back in the encoding of the response. This means that we only need to decode queries, but not encode them so much as just write the exact same bytes to the response packet (this is jumping ahead a little bit, see below for the discovery of the expense of Query serialization). The 'a is the lifetime associated with the answers. These lifetimes are associated with Authority in the Catalog of the Server. There used to be a clone of each of those answer Records, but now we share a reference back to the Authority so there is no clone.\nTo get the numbers associated to this change, I hacked the code into a really ugly state. It's a testament to Rust that it still works. Many other languages I'm sure I would have introduced some bugs, but this still passes all the tests. We are getting closer to our goal. I am a little disappointed with a particular part of this change, though. In the Catalog there is a ReadWriteLock which wraps the Authority serving records. Originally, this would construct a fully owned Message for response. Now, if you notice, most of the Records in MessageResponse are references with associated lifetimes. Those lifetimes are from the inner Authority record sets in which they are stored, but because they are returned in a critical section of the ReadWriteLock during lookup, we can no longer pass the MessageResponse out from RequestHandler. The reason this is disappointing is more obvious in the change to the request_handle signature:\nfn handle_request(&amp;self, request: &amp;Request) -&gt; Message;\n\nbecomes:\nfn fn handle_request&lt;'q, 'a&gt;(&amp;'a self, request: &amp;'q Request, response_handle: ResponseHandle) -&gt; io::Result;\n\nBefore there was a compile time guarantee that a handler would return a Message to send back to a client. Now, there is no compilation validation that a Message will always be sent. I'd really like to continue to enforce this guarantee, but haven't yet come up with a clear solution. At least something is required to be returned, but the former was a stronger guarantee. I may add a type that can only be created by ResponseHandle when a response is sent that must be returned, which may be an acceptable compromise.\nSerialization is Expensive\nNow we get into some serialization issues. Looking through the instruments run data again we have this:\n32.0ms    2.3%\t32    2.3%\t0.0\ttrust_dns_server..authority..message_response..MessageResponse::emit_queries\n22.0ms    1.6%\t22    1.6%\t1.0\ttrust_dns_server..authority..message_response..MessageResponse::emit_name_servers\n12.0ms    0.8%\t12    0.8%\t1.0\ttrust_dns_proto..rr..resource..Record::emit\n12.0ms    0.8%\t12    0.8%\t2.0 trust_dns_server..authority..message_response..MessageResponse::emit_answers\n\nOnce these records are stored in the Authority they really don't change, so why not just pre-serialize them? Digging into those calls, it turns out that our friend Name is the most expensive thing to serialize. But the first thing we can quickly do, is preserve the bytes on the Querys (as already briefly mentioned), we have that passed in from the Request. The serialization of these sections of the Message don't even appear in the capture any more as hotspots. I should take a look at how EDNS is being serialized, but first I have a lot of cleanup of these changes to do. I considered pre-serializing all the Records as stored in the Authority, but this would make label compression harder and also make dynamic updates more difficult for things like compare-and-swap operations. It would be a bummer to increase the speed of the server only to discover that we've increased packet size dramatically and also made maintenance of the project much worse (see Revisiting all that String duplication above).\nStop Creating Intermediary Objects\nFor EDNS it turns out that we're first creating a Record and then serializing that record. The EDNS object is generally constructed per connection, the cost is surprising:\n14.0ms    1.2%\t14    1.2%\t1.0\t \t           trust_dns_proto::rr::rdata::opt::emit\n12.0ms    1.0%\t12    1.0%\t8.0\t \t            trust_dns_proto::rr::rdata::opt::EdnsOption::from\n\nFor this one, I'm going to get rid of the intermediate construction of the Record object and just stream the data directly. While fixing this code, I discovered that I was doing a pretty expensive operation to temporarily capture the rdata portion of the Record as a Vec&lt;u8&gt; just so that I could get its final size (in DNS the RData of a Record is preceded by a u16 and then the binary data); this is a huge waste (and it happens during all Record serialization, not just EDNS). To get around this, I've added a new interface to the BinEncoder that allows you to capture a place in the buffer, and then write back to it when done. This should allow for a lot of serialization routines to be improved. It mimics the new unstable feature in the stdlib, Place.\nAfter fixing EDNS, I went back and applied this fix to all Record serialization.\nFixup Label Compression\nLabel compression in DNS is pretty straight forward: basically don't duplicate names already written to the packet. This was being tracked in the BinEncoder with a HashMap storing labels which would be inspected for each label being added. This was defined as owning Strings (I didn't show the things which directed me here from Instruments' output, but it was clear that this was expensive from that tool):\nname_pointers: HashMap&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;, u16&gt;\n\nIt made encoding labels into the message an expensive process because each String would be cloned into the map (and a Vec) allocated for each set of labels. We can simplify this to just store offsets into the buffer being written, and be much more memory/allocation efficient:\nname_pointers: Vec&lt;(u32, u32)&gt;\n\nNow when processing labels, we always write the set of labels to the buffer, then take slices into the buffer and compare those to see if they can be replaced with an excerpt from another already serialized Name:\npub fn emit_as_canonical(&amp;self, encoder: &amp;mut BinEncoder, canonical: bool) -&gt; ProtoResult&lt;()&gt; {\n    /// ... canonical case not shown ....\n\n            // our set of labels from this Name\n            let labels: &amp;[Rc&lt;String&gt;] = &amp;self.labels;\n\n            // start index of each label\n            let mut labels_written: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(labels.len());\n\n            // we first write all our labels to the buffer,\n            //   this get's us the encoded form we're going to use for the &amp;[u8] comparison to other already serialized labels\n            for label in labels {\n                // track the labels position in the buffer\n                labels_written.push(encoder.offset());\n\n                // now write the label\n                encoder.emit_character_data(label)?;\n            }\n\n            // we've written all the labels to the buf, the current offset is the end\n            let last_index = encoder.offset();\n\n            // now search for other labels already stored matching from the beginning label, strip them to the end\n            //   if it's not found, then store this as a new label\n            for label_idx in &amp;labels_written {\n                // this method on encoder is designed to search all stored (see name_pointers mentioned above)\n                //   and if there is any matching return they're offset (we only ne the start index for that)\n                let label_ptr: Option&lt;u16&gt; = encoder.get_label_pointer(*label_idx, last_index);\n\n                if let Some(loc) = label_ptr {\n                    // We found a matching label, reset back to the\n                    //   beginning of this label, and then write the pointer...\n                    encoder.set_offset(*label_idx);\n\n                    // chop off the labels that we had already written to the buffer\n                    encoder.trim();\n                    \n                    // write out the pointer marker\n                    //  or'd with the location which shouldn't be larger than this 2^14 or 16k\n                    encoder.emit_u16(0xC000u16 | (loc &amp; 0x3FFFu16))?;\n\n                    // we found a pointer don't check the rest of the labels\n                    //   (they are all contained at the end of that pointer)\n                    return Ok(());\n                } else {\n                    // no existing label exists, store this new one.\n                    encoder.store_label_pointer(*label_idx, last_index);\n                }\n            }\n// ...\n}\n\nThe Finish Line\nSo after all of these changes, did we achieve our goal?\ntest trust_dns_udp_bench      ... bench:      68,173 ns/iter (+/- 11,699)\n\nand BIND9 (rerunning benches to make sure there was nothing accidentally in the Client that would have favored TRust-DNS)\ntest bind_udp_bench           ... bench:      69,576 ns/iter (+/- 3,620)\n\nNow the +/- is obviously a problem with TRust-DNS, and some point it would be great to make that more consistent. Is it an honest claim that TRust-DNS is faster than BIND9? For this simple test case, TRust-DNS is consistently faster than BIND9. But is it fair? Not really, BIND9 still has many more features than TRust-DNS, also there are many other configurations where we may not be faster, such as TCP based requests, dynamic update, DNSSec record signing, etc. For querying www.example.com of type A from a local server, I do feel confident in claiming we are faster.\nI would like to go back and cleanup some other things (like I mentioned at the beginning). But with the help of measurements they weren't necessary to achieve this goal, so those can be done at a later date.\nThank you!\nMaking all these improvements required a lot of API changes, and became super ugly at different points. While I'm happy to have achieved my goal, it took me a while to clean up the code. I posted this tweet, a while ago. It's taken me quite a while to clean up all the changes so that I could submit them to the library (at which point I came back and edited this post). This was a slog to say the least.\nOne thing that happened while I was working on this change, @little-dude submitted a new PR which looks to have shaved off approximately another microsecond in #311, without which I don't think we'd have beaten BIND9. Thanks for helping me on this quest!\nThank you for reading this meandering post, I hope you enjoyed it. I definitely enjoyed digging into these issues in the code. It's in the dark corners of software that past decisions continue to haunt.\nHappy New Year!\nThank you to my beautiful wife, Lyndsey, for editing this post\n\n\n1) About the Measurements\n\nI'm not being scientific here, so don't get up in arms if my methods aren't perfect. You're welcome to reproduce these results or improve the methods. Everything is publicly available. Rust has a nice benchmarking testing facility (requires nightly as of the time of this writing). I wrote a wrapper for launching the TRust-DNS or BIND9 named binaries. These are loaded with the same zone configuration file; this is not fancy. What I'm interested in is the round-trip time of a UDP DNS request. In the future more benches can be added for things like dynamic update, zone transfer, zone signing, concurrency, etc. The config.log output matches the one I used for building the BIND9 binary. If you think I should change any of that, let me know.\nTo be clear, the client being used for these measurements is consistent between the two servers. The only thing we should be measuring is the time it takes the client to send and receive a response from the server being tested. The query is simply for the A records with the name www.example.com. I don't believe I've done anything that would give either BIND9 or TRust-DNS a bias. Also a big note here: I wrote this post while working through these changes. I've been working on this in my spare time over the course of a month. During that time a few OS updates came out, and the performance of both BIND9 and TRust-DNS suffered as a result of those OS upgrades. I had planned on tracking the improvement each change had on the overall benchmark performance, but it wasn't possible because those OS upgrades also caused each server to have overall worse performance. Approximately 5µs were lost due to the recent macOS updates. All of the changes in this post are in this PR: #317. If you notice poor verb tense agreement throughout this post, the reason is that I tried many different options, reverted many and continued in different directions (I hope it doesn't distract too much from the content).\n\n\n2) I received a lot of great feedback on my lack of punycode support here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/7my0m0/making_trustdns_faster_than_bind9/. It's clear that I need to drop support for UTF8 from the wire, as much as it pains me to have to support this backward compatible format. #321 is now open on the project for this, and maybe I'll work on that next. \n\n\n3) See previous article, They're not Generics; they're TypeParameters\n\n\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/making-trust-dns-fast/","title":"Making TRust-DNS faster than BIND9"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/moved-to-github/":{"body":"301 Moved Permanently\nI was stuck on Blogger.

A service I had built made it possible to discover CORBA services on the network and link them together. This was just before zero-conf started becoming popular through, Apple's Bonjour, mDNS, LLMNR, and many other technologies that were being standardized. It was a lot of fun, and ever since working with it I have always wanted to use it for more things.\nFast forward a few years to the TRust-DNS project; very early on in the project I decided I wanted to implement mDNS, multicast DNS, issue #24. Finally I've had some time to do this and I have gotten to learn a bunch more about multicasting, especially the differences of implementations between macOS, Linux, and Windows (the three platforms supported by TRust-DNS). Also, this is the first time I've done any multicasting in IPv6, which is surprising in its nuanced differences.\nWhat is multicasting?\nWhen sending IP packets on networks there are generally two different protocols used, UDP and TCP. TCP always operates point-to-point, meaning there is only ever one src (source) and one dst (destination). The src and dst are specified as a pair of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) and a port. The reason TCP is point-to-point is that it is session oriented, meaning both ends of the connection maintain information about what packets have been sent or received and then will attempt to resend any that were lost. UDP on the other hand is fire-and-forget, meaning that when a UDP packet is lost, there is no attempt by the underlying protocol to resend the packet. There are four basic modes for sending packets on a network over IP:\n\nunicast: single src to single dst (TCP and UDP)\n\nThis is what most people are using when they are sending data between network sources. This is where packets are being sent from a src to a dst, and only those two things care about it. Mind you, there is nothing that prevents any router on any network in-between from looking at and doing whatever it wants with these packets (this is true of all IP protocols). You need to add TLS over TCP or DTLS over UDP to create any privacy of your packets (or similar), though you can't really hide the src and dst on packets. Even with network encapsulation over something like a VPN (virtual private network), the VPN knows the ultimate src and dst.\n\nbroadcast: many src to many dst on a single network (UDP)\n\nBroadcasting is basically a thing of the past, only available in IPv4 (IPv6 must use multicast). This is the last address in a network, for example 198.51.100/24 the last address is 198.51.100.255. The most useful thing that uses it is DHCP for dynamically configuring your network information on your computer. Broadcasting can create a lot of congestion on networks that span routers or switches, which is one reason why networks tend to be kept limited in size and also scope.\n\nanycast: single src to one of many dst (TCP* and UDP)\n\nAnycasting is used to generally allow for the geographical distribution of service end-points, for example DNS. With UDP when the order and sequence of the packets doesn't matter, this is generally easily configured. Basically, in anycast the \"closest\" dst will win, derived from weights configured across all of the routes. There is no guarantee that a packet will end up in the same place.\n* TCP relies on a stable src and dst, anycast addresses can be configured to be reliable for TCP, but it takes a lot of care.\n\nmulticast: many src to many dst (UDP and RTP*)\n\nFinally, the point of this post, multicasting gives the ability for many srcs to deliver packets to many dsts. Similar to broadcasting, but it allows for these distributed packets to be delivered to more nodes than just the ones attached to the hosts network. Multicast attempts to reduce congestion by requiring services that wish to receive multicast packets to \"join\" a multicast address for interest. These joins are then announced to upstream routers, where different network address spaces define the scope or range up the network stack that these memberships should be announced (see rfc5771 and rfc7346 for IPv4 and IPv6 registrations). This is to help prevent floods of multicast traffic hitting the internet at large. For our uses, you'll see that mDNS is defined to operate on 224.0.0.251 and FF02::FB, both of these are defined to be link-local multicast addresses, meaning they should not leave the local network (similar to the restriction on broadcast). This post isn't meant to be restricted to multicasting in mDNS, but that is what inspired this post.\n* RTP, real-time protocol, is a new protocol implemented over UDP mainly for audio and/or video delivery. WebRTC being a major use-case. RTP can be used over multicast, but I personally haven't done anything with it, so can't comment much more about it's potential or the implementation details as they relate to multicast.\nWhen should you use multicasting?\nWhenever you need to deliver the same data to many destinations. In mDNS what is being delivered to all nodes on the network is a query, and also announcements of new services on the network, you can read more details in rfc6762, specifically section 5. When dealing with link-local multicast, this is generally going to be ok. Be aware that many networks configurations make it difficult to multicast beyond the link-local network, so good luck.\nYou should be careful when deploying multicast software that spans networks. As networks of systems grow, the amount of traffic associated with multicast starts growing exponentially very quickly. Thought should be put into how this traffic can be reduced, for example, sections 7 and 8 of rfc6762 have suggestions for this in mDNS.\nMulticasting in Rust\nMulticasting is not very different from standard UDP. There is a sender and a receiver, the src and the dst as normal. The difference being that the desitination IP address being sent to is a multicast address 224.0.0.0/4 IPv4 or ff00::/8 IPv6. Those are large network spaces, and the Wikipedia article does a decent job of explaining what they are for. There are some caveats though; while IPv4 will generally just work, IPv6 requires you to specify the interface on which you send the multicast packets (I'll get to this further on).\nIn general if you want to both send and receive multicast packets, you will need to create two sockets, one for outbound multicast packets, and one for inbound. We'll go through this process by first creating the multicast receiver. And then move on to the sender. The stdlib of Rust does not yet have all of the multicast options needed, so we need to turn to another library. We'll be using the socket2 library which exposes the necessary options from libc. One thing that surprised me while working on this support in TRust-DNS was that I ended up being the person who had the pleasure of adding the IPv6 multicast socket option bindings to libc and socket2, which is surprisingly easy! If you notice things missing while you're working on similarly low-level features, you should definitely not be put off by process or working with the maintainers to get those changes in.\nFor the rest of this post, this repo has the complete project and a step-by-step commit history: bluejekyll/multicast-example\nGetting the basics out of the way\nAdd the dependency on socket2 in your Cargo.toml:\nsocket2 = { version = \"0.3.4\", features = [\"reuseport\"] }\n\nWe need a minimum of 0.3.4, which contains all of the IPv6 options and also a bug fixed. The reuseport feature is going to enable SO_REUSE_PORT on Unix systems. This feature should work on recent versions of Linux and BSD systems. It may work in the Windows Linux environment. This is going to allow us to \"share\" the multicast address and port on which we'll be listening. I don't get into the details of this in this post, but this is useful if you want many multicast listeners on the same host.\nNext in your bin.rs, lib.rs, or main.rs we'll externalize the crate for usage in our program:\nextern crate socket2;\n\nOk, so now we have our nuts and bolts.\nSetting up some boiler plate\nTRust-DNS uses Tokio, but I'm going to leave tokio out of these examples and use blocking IO to keep everything simple. The initial socket creation is identical, but the operations would be wrapped in futures, just know that everything is basically the same. \nLet's pick a couple of addresses for our tests. We're going to use link-local scoped addresses. 224.0.0.123 and FF02::123 should be available, and let's choose a randomish port, 7645. I'm going to bring in lazy_static crate as well so that we can create static references to these addresses.\nCargo.toml:\nlazy_static = \"1.0\"\n\nand lib.rs:\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate lazy_static;\n\nlazy_static relies on a macro for it's static construction which is why we need this.\nNow let's define the static fields in our lib.rs, at this point we'll have:\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate lazy_static;\nextern crate socket2;\n\nuse std::net::{IpAddr, Ipv4Addr, Ipv6Addr, SocketAddr};\n\npub const PORT: u16 = 7645;\nlazy_static! {\n    pub static ref IPV4: IpAddr = Ipv4Addr::new(224, 0, 0, 123).into();\n    pub static ref IPV6: IpAddr = Ipv6Addr::new(0xFF02, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x0123).into();\n}\n\nRust's stdlib can test that the addresses are in the right scope for our use. Let's start building up our test cases:\n#[test]\nfn test_ipv4_multicast() {\n    assert!(IPV4.is_multicast());\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test_ipv6_multicast() {\n    assert!(IPV6.is_multicast());\n}\n\nNow if you run cargo test we'll see that at least our addresses are in scope. Now let's add the listener. First we're going to start with our boiler plate for the thread:\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Barrier};\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\nuse std::thread::{self, JoinHandle};\n\nfn multicast_listener(\n    response: &amp;'static str,\n    client_done: Arc&lt;AtomicBool&gt;,\n    addr: SocketAddr,\n) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;()&gt; {\n    // A barrier to not start the client test code until after the server is running\n    let server_barrier = Arc::new(Barrier::new(2));\n    let client_barrier = Arc::clone(&amp;server_barrier);\n\n    let join_handle = std::thread::Builder::new()\n        .name(format!(\"{}:server\", response))\n        .spawn(move || {\n            // socket creation will go here...\n\n            server_barrier.wait();\n            println!(\"{}:server: is ready\", response);\n\n            // We'll be looping until the client indicates it is done.\n            while !client_done.load(std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed) {\n                // test receive and response code will go here...\n            }\n\n            println!(\"{}:server: client is done\", response);\n        })\n        .unwrap();\n\n    client_barrier.wait();\n    join_handle\n}\n\n/// This will guarantee we always tell the server to stop\nstruct NotifyServer(Arc&lt;AtomicBool&gt;);\nimpl Drop for NotifyServer {\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.0.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);\n    }\n}\n\n/// Our generic test over different IPs\nfn test_multicast(test: &amp;'static str, addr: IpAddr) {\n    assert!(addr.is_multicast());\n    let addr = SocketAddr::new(addr, PORT);\n\n    let client_done = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));\n    NotifyServer(Arc::clone(&amp;client_done));\n\n    multicast_listener(test, client_done, addr);\n\n    // client test code send and receive code after here\n    println!(\"{}:client: running\", test);\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test_ipv4_multicast() {\n    test_multicast(\"ipv4\", *IPV4);\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test_ipv6_multicast() {\n    test_multicast(\"ipv6\", *IPV6);\n}\n\nOk that's a bit more code. What we're doing in that block in there is starting a thread that's going to run our server logic. We're making using of a Barrier to synchronize the server and the client such that the client does not attempt to run the tests before the server is running. We also have an AtomicBool for indicating when the server can safely stop running. I've also moved the client test section to a generic test case regardless of IPv4 or IPv6. Doing this makes testing client/server code easy.\nWhen you run the tests you should see some decent output:\n$&gt; cargo test -- --nocapture\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\n     Running target/debug/deps/multicast_example-82a50da931778747\n\nrunning 2 tests\nipv4:server: is ready\nipv4:client: running\nipv6:server: is ready\nipv6:client: running\nipv4:server: client is done\nipv6:server: client is done\ntest test_ipv4_multicast ... ok\ntest test_ipv6_multicast ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out\n\n   Doc-tests multicast-example\n\nrunning 0 tests\n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out\n\nOk great, basics are out of the way. Now we can get on to the meat of the problem. Code in test harnesses ready commit\nCreating the multicast listener\nNo we're going to build up our multicast socket. We'll be using the socket2 library and not std::net for much of this. You can wrap std::net sockets in socket2::Socket, but we won't be doing that here.\nuse std::io;\nuse std::time::Duration;\n\nuse socket2::{Domain, Protocol, SockAddr, Socket, Type};\n\n// this will be common for all our sockets\nfn new_socket(addr: &amp;SocketAddr) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Socket&gt; {\n    let domain = if addr.is_ipv4() {\n        Domain::ipv4()\n    } else {\n        Domain::ipv6()\n    };\n\n    let socket = Socket::new(domain, Type::dgram(), Some(Protocol::udp()))?;\n\n    // we're going to use read timeouts so that we don't hang waiting for packets\n    socket.set_read_timeout(Some(Duration::from_millis(100)))?;\n\n    Ok(socket)\n}\n\nfn join_multicast(addr: SocketAddr) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Socket&gt; {\n    let ip_addr = addr.ip();\n\n    let socket = new_socket(&amp;addr)?;\n\n    // depending on the IP protocol we have slightly different work\n    match ip_addr {\n        IpAddr::V4(ref mdns_v4) =&gt; {\n            // join to the multicast address, with all interfaces\n            socket.join_multicast_v4(mdns_v4, &amp;Ipv4Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0))?;\n        }\n        IpAddr::V6(ref mdns_v6) =&gt; {\n            // join to the multicast address, with all interfaces (ipv6 uses indexes not addresses)\n            socket.join_multicast_v6(mdns_v6, 0)?;\n            socket.set_only_v6(true)?;\n        }\n    };\n\n    // bind us to the socket address.\n    socket.bind(&amp;SockAddr::from(addr))?;\n    Ok(socket)\n}\n\nAnd we'll be adding the join into the multicast_listener function:\n// socket creation will go here...\nlet listener = join_multicast(addr);\nprintln!(\"{}:server: joined: {}\", response, addr);\n\nHow about some more detail on each of those calls?\n\nsocket.join_multicast_*(address, interface)\n\nThis is the most important call, it tells the specified interface that you would like it to \"join\" the specified multicast group designated by address. If interface is IPv4 0.0.0.0 or the IPv6 index 0, then all interfaces will be joined to the multicast group.\n\nsocket.bind(address)\n\nThis is special, it expresses to the kernel that we are only interested in messages for address, i.e. it should filter out any other packets, at least this is how it works on Unix like systems. When we look at Windows we'll be coming back to this. The other option for this would be to bind to 0.0.0.0 IPv4 or :: IPv6, but then we'd receive traffic on any interface sent to our port. By binding to the multicast group address we are saying to the kernel, we only want the multicast traffic.\nAnd that's it, we now have a listener. Running the tests we should see:\nipv4:server: joined: 224.0.0.123:7645\nipv6:server: joined: [ff02::123]:7645\nipv4:server: is ready\nipv6:server: is ready\nipv4:client: running\nipv6:client: running\nipv4:server: client is done\nipv6:server: client is done\n\nExcellent, we are now joined to the multicast group. Code in join_multicast commit\nWiring it all together\nThe next step is going to be to send some data to the server. So we'll create a new socket on the client to do this:\nfn new_sender(addr: &amp;SocketAddr) -&gt; io::Result&lt;UdpSocket&gt; {\n    let socket = new_socket(addr)?;\n\n    if addr.is_ipv4() {\n        socket.bind(&amp;SockAddr::from(SocketAddr::new(\n            Ipv4Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0).into(),\n            0,\n        )))?;\n    } else {\n        socket.bind(&amp;SockAddr::from(SocketAddr::new(\n            Ipv6Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).into(),\n            0,\n        )))?;\n    }\n\n    Ok(socket)\n}\n\nWe're binding to any interface with the above, and a random port. Now we can send to the multicast listener (this replaces the section in test_multicast), add sender commit:\n// client test code send and receive code after here\nprintln!(\"{}:client: running\", test);\n\nlet message = b\"Hello from client!\";\n\n// create the sending socket\nlet socket = new_sender(&amp;addr).expect(\"could not create sender!\");\nsocket\n    .send_to(message, &amp;SockAddr::from(addr))\n    .expect(\"could not send_to!\");\n\nAnd let's run tests:\n$ cargo test\n...\ntest test_ipv4_multicast ... ok\ntest test_ipv6_multicast ... FAILED\n\nOn macOS the failure is due to No route to host. But why did it work for IPv4 and not IPv6? Well, it seems that at least on macOS the interface must be specified for IPv6. I need to look more into this, as this doesn't appear to be a requirement in many of the texts that I've read on the matter (and may have changed in recent OS releases). Digging around, the claim is that all you need is a route for the network, well:\n$ netstat -nr\n...\nff02::%lo0/32                           ::1                             UmCI            lo0\nff02::%en0/32                           link#5                          UmCI            en0\nff02::%awdl0/32                         link#7                          UmCI          awdl0\n\nThat output claims that for our test address FF02::123 we have three routes defined, so we should have a route. Please send me feedback if you see an obvious problem with my methods here, and have a solution. In any case, a workaround is to use ifconfig -v to get the index of the interface you want to use for IPv6. Then you can add this flag specific for multicast delivery:\n/// to be consistent we'll add ipv4 default as well\nsocket.set_multicast_if_v4(&amp;Ipv4Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0))?;\n...\n\n/// and IPv6, this is specific to my machine\nsocket.set_multicast_if_v6(5)?;\n\nWhat this essentially does is specify precisely which interface the multicast packets should be delivered on. For IPv4 that's just specifying the default. Now when we run the test both IPv4 and IPv6 tests should pass. fix ipv6 outbound multicast commit\nAcknowledge receipt\nNow we'll add the final piece to the puzzle, which is to respond to the message from the server. To do this, the multicast listener needs to read the inbound data, and then respond to it. This will require an additional socket. If you remember, we bound the listener's socket to the multicast address, which means we can't use it for delivering the response. But that's easy, we have our socket creation function, and since this is just for testing, we'll be wasteful and create a new socket for every response, note I changed join_multicast and new_sender to convert to and return std::net::UdpSocket to make some code simpler: add response and validate commit\n// test receive and response code will go here...\nlet mut buf = [0u8; 64]; // receive buffer\n\n// we're assuming failures were timeouts, the client_done loop will stop us\nmatch listener.recv_from(&amp;mut buf) {\n    Ok((len, remote_addr)) =&gt; {\n        let data = &amp;buf[..len];\n\n        println!(\n            \"{}:server: got data: {} from: {}\",\n            response,\n            String::from_utf8_lossy(data),\n            remote_addr\n        );\n\n        // create a socket to send the response\n        let responder = new_socket(&amp;remote_addr)\n            .expect(\"failed to create responder\")\n            .into_udp_socket();\n\n        // we send the response that was set at the method beginning\n        responder\n            .send_to(response.as_bytes(), &amp;remote_addr)\n            .expect(\"failed to respond\");\n\n        println!(\"{}:server: sent response to: {}\", response, remote_addr);\n    }\n    Err(err) =&gt; {\n        println!(\"{}:server: got an error: {}\", response, err);\n    }\n}\n\nSo now the server is getting the client's message and the server is responding to the message. We are responding to the client on the address received on this message. A side note here on trusting the UDP remote_addr: because UDP is not session oriented, just because the message through remote_addr claims to be from a particular host, this is by no means necessarily the case. If you want to read more about this, research reflection attacks and UDP source address spoofing. Back to this example, here are the important details:\n\nlistener.recv_from(&amp;mut buf)\n\nReceive the packet from the client into the allocated buffer we created first.\n\nOk((len, remote_addr)) =&gt; ...\n\nOn a successful receipt we're unwrapping the length of data received and the source address.\n\nlet responder = new_socket(&amp;remote_addr)\n\nCreate a new socket for the response, in the proper IP scope.\n\nresponder.send_to(response.as_bytes(), &amp;remote_addr)\n\nSend our response to the source address. The response was a string passed in at the creation of the server, so the client already knows what is coming.\nFrom here we can move on to the client to verify the server's response. A note, I realized that the NotifyServer was dropping early after getting to this point, so I changed that to capture the notify, and we're back in the test_multicast function:\nlet notify = NotifyServer(Arc::clone(&amp;client_done));\n\n// ...\n\nsocket.send_to(message, &amp;addr).expect(\"could not send_to!\");\n\nlet mut buf = [0u8; 64]; // receive buffer\n\n// get our expected response\nmatch socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf) {\n    Ok((len, remote_addr)) =&gt; {\n        let data = &amp;buf[..len];\n        let response = String::from_utf8_lossy(data);\n\n        println!(\"{}:client: got data: {}\", test, response);\n\n        // verify it's what we expected\n        assert_eq!(test, response);\n    }\n    Err(err) =&gt; {\n        println!(\"{}:client: had a problem: {}\", test, err);\n        assert!(false);\n    }\n}\n\n// make sure we don't notify the server until the end of the client test\ndrop(notify);\n\nNow if you run the tests we should see successes, I'll limit it to just IPv4 so to shorten the output:\n$ cargo test ipv4 -- --nocapture\n...\nipv4:server: joined: 224.0.0.123:7645\nipv4:server: is ready\nipv4:client: running\nipv4:server: got data: Hello from client! from: 10.0.0.195:56069\nipv4:server: sent response to: 10.0.0.195:56069\nipv4:client: got data: ipv4\nipv4:server: client is done\ntest test_ipv4_multicast ... ok\n...\n\nExcellent! We're done right?\nSupporting Windows\nIf you're happy with Unix only support you're done, but we're working in Rust, supporting multiple platforms is easy, right? Let's switch to Windows and see what happens! For this I grabbed a VM from Microsoft and installed the standard Windows Rust tools through rustup (make sure to go through a browser in the VM so that you get the correct link on the rustup site). I'm going to leave ipv6 up to the reader, so I'll just be running the IPv4 test:\nC:&gt; cargo test ipv4 -- --nocapture\n...\ntest test_ipv4_multicast ... thread 'ipv4:server' panicked at 'failed to create listener: Error { repr: Os { code: 10049, message: \"The requested address is not valid in its context.\" } }', src\\libcore\\result.rs:916:5\n...\n\nNot valid in it's context, what? Well, I have the luck of having already worked through this with the TRust-DNS mdns support. It turns out Windows doesn't want you to bind to the multicast address like Unix. So we're going to make a platform specific construct here, we'll create a bind_multicast function that has two different implementations, one for Unix and one for Windows. By the way this command comes in handy when you're developing on something other than Windows and just want to check it if builds: cargo check --tests --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc. In join_multicast we're going to replace the call to socket.bind(&amp;SockAddr::from(addr))? with bind_multicast(&amp;socket, &amp;addr)? and then add the new function:\n/// On Windows, unlike all Unix variants, it is improper to bind to the multicast address\n///\n/// see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms737550(v=vs.85).aspx\n#[cfg(windows)]\nfn bind_multicast(socket: &amp;Socket, addr: &amp;SocketAddr) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let addr = match *addr {\n        SocketAddr::V4(addr) =&gt; SocketAddr::new(Ipv4Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0).into(), addr.port()),\n        SocketAddr::V6(addr) =&gt; {\n            SocketAddr::new(Ipv6Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).into(), addr.port())\n        }\n    };\n    socket.bind(&amp;socket2::SockAddr::from(addr))\n}\n\n/// On unixes we bind to the multicast address, which causes multicast packets to be filtered\n#[cfg(unix)]\nfn bind_multicast(socket: &amp;Socket, addr: &amp;SocketAddr) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    socket.bind(&amp;socket2::SockAddr::from(*addr))\n}\n\nAll we've done is tell Windows to listen on all interfaces, but restrict it to the multicast port. We're still joining in the same way as before. You could limit this to a specific interface if you like, but that's up to the reader. But this is it, our code is now cross platform. What about IPv6? Well, I have to apologize. I can't seem to get IPv6 working on Windows, regardless of changing the target. I'll leave that to some intrepid Rustacean on Windows to figure out.\nConclusion\nMulticasting in IPv4 in Rust is straightforward. In IPv6 there are still some issues to work through, like finding an easy way to deal with the interface problem, and determining what is wrong on Windows. IPv6 leaves me dissatisfied, so I'll be continuing to look for solutions here. I'd love feedback from others who might know what, if anything, I'm doing wrong there. I ended up not getting into this in this post, but when multiple multicast listeners are on the same host for the same traffic, you will need to use set_reuse_address and set_reuse_port (where applicable) to allow for the listeners to use the same addresses.\nI hope you enjoyed this post. Figuring all of this out for mDNS was a lot of testing, trial-and-error; the long list of commits is here for the mdns_stream. The mDNS support is not yet complete in TRust-DNS but that mdns_stream (similar to what we did in this post) is the first step in getting there.\nThank you!\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/multicasting-in-rust/","title":"Multicasting in Rust"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/my-bike-is-rusty/":{"body":"Imagine this, you're riding along on your bike into work, a dude rolls up next you on his fixie, and says,\n\"you've got the wrong dropouts, that's not safe\". To which I laugh and then say, \"it's not a problem\". To\nwhich he says, \"well, it's harder to adjust the wheel\". I conceded this point, \"yes, it is, but my frame\nwas way less expensive\". Mind you, we were having this conversation over the course of a block, between\nlights. After the next light, I rode off leaving his pretty black fixie with matching purple hubs behind\n(after doing an obligatory track stop while waiting for the light to turn), but it did get me thinking...\nWhat is important on a bike?\nIf he could have kept up with me, and we had more time, I would have told him what is more important than dropouts.\nHere is a picture of my bike:\n\nThe first thing you will notice is that it's a Falcon, based on some\nphotos I found\nprobably 1960's model. This is a rare bike to find these days, as the company was bought\nand sold over the years. This was (is?) a British bike manufacturer, visit the wiki page, it's like Schwinn, completely different company now.\nYou might notice something interesting about that frame. It's rusty. Don't worry, it's solid, but it looks like crap.\nThe looks like crap part was important.\nI live in San Francisco, bikes are stolen all the time. I wanted a bike that no one in their right mind would go through\nthe effort of trying to steal, but looks can be deceiving. I put this bike together about 14 years ago. The\nfirst thing I did was go and find a frame. I walked into a used bike shop, and asked for the crappiest looking 57 cm frame,\nthat was actually still in good condition. The guy pulled the frame off the wall, at this point all\nthat was on the bike was the front fork and headset, it had a bottom bracket (the part where the bike pedal crank arms\nattach/pass through to the bike) and that's it. It cost me a whopping $25. This was going to be a fixie, so I asked the\nguy to grab used parts for everything, but I handed him the 42 tooth front chainring, and a rear flip-flop hub and wheel\nthat came with 15 tooth sprockets, aero bars and a used Nitto stem to use for the build. A week later I went in and\ngrabbed the bike and started riding. I won't get into learning to ride a fixed gear bike here, but let's just say that\nit's interesting.\nThe upgrades\nFixed gear bikes take more stress in different areas of the bike that do standard road bikes. The first is at the neck\nof the bike, where the fork passes through frame.\nFirst upgrade: the headset\nI started noticing that the headset had a lot of play (wiggled a lot). I tried to adjust it myself a bunch, but it was\nclear a new headset was needed. I got a Shimano 105 headset. 105 is not the best, and it's not the worst. In my opinion\nit is the most solid. The reason this part went bad is that when your climbing hills on a fixie, you put a lot of stress\non the headset as you rock the bike back and forth (also it was old).  If you notice those aero bars, they allow me to\nreally throw the bike from side to side to apply more power to the pedals. Since you can't change gears, you need to\npush a lot with your arms side-to-side.\nSecond upgrade: the bottom bracket\nSimilar to the headset, the bottom bracket takes a lot of stress when your pushing down hard with your legs. Again\nthis is more stress than normal, because you can't change gears, you have to push harder. Shimano 105 comes to\nthe rescue again.\nThird upgrade: pedals and cranks\nWhile obvious to some, on a fixed gear bike, if the bike is moving then so are the pedals. This can be challenging on hills,\nwhich is why you'll notice I cheat by having a front brake. While in turns though, you get to\nlearn something new about cycling, the pedal scratch. When this happens, try not to freak out. You're pedal hits the ground,\ncausing your rear wheel to temporarily leave the ground, and then your heart skips a beat, as you realize you have lost\ncontrol and are about to hit a car coming up that narrow street you're turning on to. When your rear wheel leaves the ground\nyour momentum tries to continue in a straight line rather than staying on the curve. Of course, the thought of \"why am I\nriding a fixed gear?\" crosses your mind, seriously, it's not that cool people. This only lasts for a millisecond, once your\npedal rotates a little more, your rear wheel will reconnect with the road, and then ideally you don't fall. After doing this\nmore than once, you start researching for replacement parts. Answer: shorter crank arms, and narrower pedals, specifically,\nI really like the MKS narrow track pedals. Pedal scratches are now rare.\nWhile on pedals, I like the confidence I get with straps and clips. On my road bike, clipless is the way to go, but this\nis my city bike. I want to wear regular shoes, and that strap is important. When stopping, you need to pull up on the strap\nto help slow down. They're also immensely helpful for pulling up on uphills, but not as good as clipless pedals, since\nthey have more play. On my fixie, I just don't trust that my foot wouldn't popout of a clipless peddle, so it's the classic\ntoe clip for me.\nFourth and most important upgrade: the rear hub\nHere is a closer picture of that area:\n\nI initially had a cheap flip-flop hub. In theory flip-flops allow you to choose between the free-wheel and the fixed-wheel\nsides. I learned two things with this: first, don't buy weak stuff for your bike; second,\nit takes enough work to mount your rear-wheel that you will never flip it. One day while stopping on my bike, I had a huge\nsurprise, I was pushing back hard to slow down and then pling I was no longer stopping. I ran into my friend in front of\nme, but luckily had slowed down enough that neither of us got hurt. Let's not concern ourselves with what would have\nhappened if he wasn't in front of me. I replaced that crappy hub, with the greatest hub ever, a Phil Wood hub, $200 worth\npure awesomeness, with a 13 tooth sprocket. A 42 tooth chainring with a 13 tooth sprocket is a pretty decent compromise\nbetween speed and power, downhills and uphills. I'm thinking of dropping down one more to 42/12 when I upgrade these\ncomponents, but that might be too big a jump. One thing you want to do with a fixie is keep your chain as short as\npossible, you do this by playing with the ratio, the number of teeth on the chainring to sprocket. A shorter chain, means less\njoints in the chain, and fewer things that can go wrong.\nThe piece that failed on my previous hub was the lockring. That screws on over the sprocket, securing the sprocket in place.\nthe threads on my old hub failed on the lockring. This doesn't matter when you're pedaling forward, but when pushing backward to\nslow the bike you apply pressure against the sprocket in the direction that would unscrew it from the hub. This is where\nthe lockring is immensely important, and also the most dangerous point for a lockring to fail. After this failure, I decided\nto get the best, the best is Phil Wood.\nMaintenance? What maintenance?\nAfter all those upgrades, (and this is 100% honest), I haven't done one thing to any major component\non the bike, not the chain, sprocket, chainring, not even new tires2 in 10 years. It is solid. Now, I expect that this\ndude with his purple matching hubs has had a similar experience with his bike. And don't get me wrong, he has a pretty\nbike, I'm sure you paid a pretty penny for it too. I know those weren't Phil Wood's so I'd recommend being very careful with\nyour hubs, and lockring (and invest in a good lock). As to the dropouts, rear facing dropout are \"better\", but I secure that\nPhil Wood to the frame pretty damn good. I've never had an issue with the hub sliding forward, and is harder to adjust the\ntension of the chain without the track dropouts. But if you look at the chain in the picture above, I bet you won't notice\nany slack, so it's not that bad. And as a bonus, I've left my bike locked outside some joints over the years, even overnight,\nand no one touched it (it's amazing the locks bike thieves can defeat).\nRecently I've been noticing a little creaking sound coming from my chain. I think it's time to finally do some work and\nreplace the chainring, sprocket and chain. Then one day, maybe get a pair of these in red,\nnot purple.\nUPDATE: I finally put some work into the bike, new cog, chainring and bolts, chain, everything is running beautifully.\n\n1) There are people who don't ride with breaks at all on fixies. If you were actually on a track, this\nmakes sense. But when you're riding in the city, you should always have a front break. Without it you're just putting\nyourself, and possibly others at risk.\n2) It turns out that if you stop skidding on that back tire you don't have to change it every couple of\nmonths. It looks cool, but do you really want to be buying tires all the time? And those Gatorskins that survive glass\n(no joke, no flats in six years) are not cheap.\n\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/my-bike-is-rusty/","title":"My bike is rusty"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/rust-and-the-most-elegant-fsm/":{"body":"FSM, what?\nFor anyone who has studied Computer Science, finite state machines are drilled into your head without mercy (or should have been, go ask for you $$$,$$$'s back if these were not drilled into your head). The first CS class I took in college was basically all FSM's, DFA's (deterministic finite automaton) and Turing machines. I don't want to get into the difference between all of these, I'm only going to refer to FSM's. In this example I'm more specifically defining a DFA, as all of the states are known, and there is a begin and end.\nOk, but why is this important? FSM's can simplify problems where you have a known input and known outputs. Specifically what I want to use one for in this example is parsing, boring old parsing. It actually wasn't until I was in the industry that I truly began to appreciate how much simpler and more maintainable your code became if you took the time to define state machines to determine how to move from one state to another.\nBackground\nFirstly, I'm still somewhat new to the Rust language, so when a \"real\" Rust person reads this, they'll probably complain that I've done xyz wrong, or should do it another way. Let me know! I'd love to understand what I could be doing better. I've been searching for a meaty project to work on to hone my skills in this language, and then I finally found one; It seems like there are security advisories that come out around DNS and specifically Bind all the time. Here is the list of all known Security Advisories in Bind9. Reading through some of the issues made me think, wtf, I'll just write a new DNS server in Rust, b/c you know, why not and it will be safe implicitly, right? While doing that, I was writing the parsers for the binary record data from the DNS rfc's and fell on a really nice way of doing FSM's in Rust.\nNow in Java I've used lots of different FSM generators, because I wanted strong language guarantees, for reference, my favorite right now was written by a friend of mine and is annotation based called Tron. This is useful because Java's enums and other basic constructs are not quite as expressive as some of the expressions you can make in Rust.\nOn to the FSM!\nThe definition of what we need to parse from RFC1035:\n3.1. Name space definitions\nDomain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence of labels.\nEach label is represented as a one octet length field followed by that\nnumber of octets. Since every domain name ends with the null label of\nthe root, a domain name is terminated by a length byte of zero. The\nhigh order two bits of every length octet must be zero, and the\nremaining six bits of the length field limit the label to 63 octets or\nless.\nTo simplify implementations, the total length of a domain name (i.e.,\nlabel octets and label length octets) is restricted to 255 octets or\nless. Although labels can contain any 8 bit values in octets that make up a\nlabel, it is strongly recommended that labels follow the preferred\nsyntax described elsewhere in this memo, which is compatible with\nexisting host naming conventions. Name servers and resolvers must\ncompare labels in a case-insensitive manner (i.e., A=a), assuming ASCII\nwith zero parity. Non-alphabetic codes must match exactly.\n\nThere are some more sections that provide details on things like pointers, you can read the spec if you want. Here are the states (I used http://madebyevan.com/fsm/ to build this, which doesn't have edge avoidance so I added some extra states to keep the lines in order):\n\nThis state diagram basically represents the above, so I decided to translate this (minus the 'offset' and 'store' states) to Rust enums.\nThis ended up being pretty elegant. but first a side note on enums in Rust.\n'enum' really?\nSo I've noticed this come up in discussions online a few times now. With questions like, \"how do you enumerate a Rust enum?\" (which has a really funny answer, IMO): You can't! Wait what? You can't enumerate a Rust enum? Why is it called an enum? No, seriously, I don't have an answer to this, why was it called 'enum', when you can't enumerate it's values (other then writing them in order, you can't in code treat them as an array or series as you can in other languages, Java/C/C++ to name a few).\nI'm sure someone has an answer to that, but in the mean time I needed to clarify them in my mind. I think they should have been called 'union's because that is what they are most closely related to. In C a union is a data type which which occupies enough memory space to only hold the largest member of the union, but what C doesn't give you is a way to know which thing in that union it really is! (read more here: C unions)\nWhat's cool in Rust is that it does tell you what's stored in the, ahem, enum. So you can write matching (or destructuring) logic like this:\nif let MyEnum::Type1 = my_var {\n   do_something_really_awesome();\n}\n\nWhich is very powerful and cool.\nFSM Now!\nOk so now for the super awesomeness of Rust. My enum is going to have four states, LabelLengthOrPointer == start, Label, Pointer, Root == end.\n/// This is the list of states for the label parsing state machine\nenum LabelParseState {\n  LabelLengthOrPointer, // basically the start of the FSM\n  Label(u8),   // storing length of the label\n  Pointer(u8), // location of pointer in slice,\n  Root,        // root is the end of the labels list, aka null\n}\n\nOk, now for the code to run the state machine:\n/// parses the chain of labels\n/// this has a max of 255 octets, with each label being less than 63.\n/// all names will be stored lowercase internally.\n/// This will consume the portions of the Vec which it is reading...\npub fn parse(slice: &amp;mut Vec&lt;u8&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;Name, FromUtf8Error&gt; {\n  let mut state: LabelParseState = LabelParseState::LabelLengthOrPointer;\n  let mut labels: Vec&lt;String&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(3); // www.example.com\n\n  // assume all chars are utf-8. We're doing byte-by-byte operations,\n  //   no endianess issues...\n  // reserved: (1000 0000 aka 0800) &amp;&amp; (0100 0000 aka 0400)\n  // pointer: (slice == 1100 0000 aka C0), then 03FF &amp; slice = offset\n  // label: 03FF &amp; slice = length; slice.next(length) = label\n  // root: 0000\n  loop {\n    state = match state {\n      LabelParseState::LabelLengthOrPointer =&gt; {\n        // determine what the next label is\n        match slice.pop() {\n          Some(0) | None =&gt; LabelParseState::Root,\n          Some(byte) if byte &amp; 0xC0 == 0xC0 =&gt;\n                                           LabelParseState::Pointer(byte &amp; 0x3F),\n          Some(byte) if byte &lt;= 0x3F =&gt; LabelParseState::Label(byte),\n          _ =&gt; unimplemented!(),\n        }\n      },\n      LabelParseState::Label(count) =&gt; {\n        labels.push(try!(util::parse_label(slice, count)));\n        // reset to collect more data\n        LabelParseState::LabelLengthOrPointer\n      },\n      LabelParseState::Pointer(offset) =&gt; {\n        // lookup in the hashmap the label to use\n        unimplemented!()\n      },\n      LabelParseState::Root =&gt; {\n        // technically could return here...\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  Ok(Name { labels: labels })\n}\n\ncode here.\nSo I'll just point out a couple of things that Rust does for us here: 1) guarantee that all states are considered 2) that each state has a result because of the assignment to the state. You'll notice that there are some unimplemented!()'s in there, that's because this is a work in progress, but I was so excited about how easy it was to write an FSM in Rust with just the standard language semantics, that I just had to share.\nBasically, the sweet sauce here is that the 'state' can carry context implicitly in the enum as part of it's tuple definition. You can obviously make that more complex than what I did here, but this was such a simple and elegant solution to a common problem.\nConclusion\nRust continues to impress me while learning it. There are definitely some oddities like enum's being called enum's when they really are something else. Also, I continue to fight the compiler on mutability around ownership, etc. It's not that I don't get the ownership model, I do... it's that after working with a GC in Java for so long, I have to train myself to think about it each time I pass a reference to something, and as far as I can tell 90% of the time I'm getting it wrong the first time.\nAnyway, getting back to hacking DNS now.\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/rust-and-the-most-elegant-fsm/","title":"Rust and the most elegant FSM"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/rust-from-a-java-dev/":{"body":"A little background\nLet me say first off, I am not one of those developers that jumps on the next cool language. I have a very specific reason why I am interested in Rust. Rust represents an evolution of systems languages of which our options have been limited now for decades. A systems language in my opinion, and I'm sure there is lots of disagreement about this, but the traits important to me are:\n\nConstant and predictable runtime\nDirect access to OS primitives and interfaces\nLow overhead for the language runtime\n\nWikipedia defines it this way:\nSystem software is computer software designed to operate and control\n the computer hardware, and to provide a platform for running application\n software. System software includes software categories such as operating\n systems, utility software, device drivers, compilers, and linkers.\n\nThat definition seems weak to me, but the line between systems and application languages had been blurred long ago. When choosing a language for any project, there should be specific criteria by which you determine what you need based on what you need to accomplish. Most languages will allow you to accomplish any task you want, but they offer features that may make what you want to do either easier or harder. Picking the right language is important, how many external libraries are available to support what you're building, how many developers exist to support you if you need to hire/contract work, how many unknown bugs or issues remain undiscovered in the language. For most of my use cases Java has always been the right language, but this post isn't about Java, it's about Rust. Also, I don't want to get into defense of Java/JVM over other languages like Go, Ruby, Scala, Clojure, etc. I've been developing in Java since 1997, and I stopped using C/C++ for anything major after 2002.\nI discovered Rust while exploring Go. This was only a few months ago, which make me a late-comer to this game. Remember the two bullet points above; constant and predictable runtime, direct access to OS primitives. Go has always confused me, is it a systems language? It's got a Garbage Collector (GC means unpredictable runtime) and it's awkward access to C structures means that it can not easily interface with the OS. It was the latter issue that brought me to Rust which allows for direct access to C structures through it's FFI (Foreign Function Interface). For you Java devs who've always hated working with JNI this is a godsend (Yes, JNA made it easier and Panama should help immensely). Go ends up being better at potentially replacing Java and the JVM.\nOn to Rust\nWhat makes Rust unique in this landscape is that it's a new language with no GC, but it at the same time it handles the memory management for you. It allows for the same direct access to C as C++ does, with no significant hurdles. Coming from a Java landscape where there are a multitudes of libraries in addition to the massive JDK standard library, what this means is you have access to not just Rust elements, but also the massive C library out there. I think of Rust as having two core features, memory safety and management. But by no means is this the limit to what Rust provides. As a Java developer not having to worry about memory allocation and deallocation is nice. I've gotten quite used to a GC which makes sure that I don't have to worry about seg faults and memory leaks any more (yes, people create memory leaks in Java too, but you have to make some very poor choices for that).\nOption&lt;T&gt;\nRust is trying to position it self as a replacement for C, and I've become convinced that unlike C++ and some other languages out there, it actually can. This is because of the fact that Rust gives you access to all the pointer primitives you have in C, but guarantees that accessing the data behind those pointers is always valid. One cool thing that I really like about Rust is that it does not allow for null, this was a little mind blowing, though after building a small project in Swift I learned how nice it is to know that the data you're accessing is either there or not.\nOption is a primitive in Rust that is used to return or pass around data which is optionally there or not. It's an enum (union) type in Rust. When in Java we gave up segmentation faults, what we replaced them with were NullPointerExceptions, the only advancement that gives us in the end is the stacktrace. Rust simply says, this data may or may not exist behind the Option type. This tells the developer immediately that you need to handle those two cases. It also gives you some handy functions at your disposal to handle the null case elegantly:\nfn unwrap_or(self, def: T) -&gt; T;\n\nWhich returns the value T if there is nothing, i.e. the Option is None. In Java 1.8 there is now the Optional type which acts the same way. I for one am going to start using this in all my future Java code as this is a very nice feature. Scala has had this from it's foundations as well.\nEnums in Rust are cool\nEnumerations in Rust are cool, they are a union type. There's not a great corollary to this in Java. The first thing to understand is that an enum in Rust allows you to define values that are stored with the enum, this is done very efficiently in the compiled code, but I won't get into that.\nLook at the Option enum:\npub enum Option&lt;T&gt; {\n    None,\n    Some(T),\n}\n\nThe first thing you'll notice as a Java dev, is that enums can be Genericized. I've wanted this so many times in Java and end up doing funky stuff to work around it. Now when using this you need to do something that was unfamiliar to me, destructuring, the unwrap() function looks like this:\nfn unwrap(self) -&gt; T {\n    if let Some(v) = self {\n        return v;\n    }\n    panic!(\"This is None, can't unwrap()\");\n}\n\nv is a locally scoped variable defined to unwrap the enum where the enum is of type Some. This type destructuring is neat and allows for very flexible usage of enums in Rust. Ok, this introduces panic! which is essentially similar to throwing a RuntimeError in Java (the ! says that this is a macro). This introduces an issue I have with the language, no exceptions (well, except for panic!). Basically, Rust allows you to throw one type of Exception, and comparing it to Errors in Java is good. Errors should not be caught in Java, they are non-recoverable. Panic is similar, and similarly should almost never be used. But they are there, and at Rust deals the the stack unwinding properly so we don't need to worry about dangling pointer issues. I'm torn as to what I'd prefer to see, and this article is a great writeup on the issue.\nErrors in Rust are a little juvenile, but still really neat\nSo this is where you can see the roots of the desire for Rust to be a bit like C. In C there are no Exceptions, there are return codes. What makes Rust's errors better than C is that since they are enums, there is no question to if the result is good or bad. Objects are generally passed in by reference and then the data returned through that referred parameter. Rust is similar, but instead uses an enum for the result:\nenum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {\n    Ok(T),\n    Err(E),\n}\n\nWhere there might be an error you return Result. I actually like this, I've noticed you're code becomes much more condensed than the try{} finally {} blocks in Java, though the AutoCloseable stuff has made that nicer. There is no finally, it seems that there has been a long debate in the Rust community about this. If you need finalization, then you need to implement the trait Drop for your struct.\nThe reason I say errors are juvenile in Rust is that it becomes hard to write functions which join different error types and return those errors. In Java it's easy to wrap any Exception and pass that up the call stack as a cause of the Exception. In Rust this still feels very awkward. In Rust you can't extend objects, all structs are final. What this means is that if you want to create a new Error type in rust, you need to write a bunch of code, or maybe I'm doing it wrong. I imagine this will get better over the coming releases.\nOwnership and Lifetimes\nThis is where Rust get's a little difficult. For Java devs it's important to think about the lifetime of objects because your always concerned with how complex the Garbage Collector will have to work, or not make dumb mistakes that lead to memory leaks. Ownership is something that you have to be concerned with when working with Threads in Java. It's also something to make sure where you don't have any dangling references. In Rust it's not just something you need to be cognizant of, you have to abide by it's strict rules related to these two concepts.\nRust introduced me to a concept of tracking Lifetimes. Initially reading the docs and specs, I thought this was going to be the hard thing to wrap my head around, but in the end it's the Ownership rules that I find to be the difficult piece. See this question I posted in Stack Overflow to get a bit of an understanding to the complexities of Ownership rules.\nLLVM\nRust compiles to the LLVM byte code. The LLVM is a really awesome concept and reality. I've been following it since Apple decided to start using it in their OS, and it's clear to mean that this is itself a game changer. The concept behind the LLVM is basically to produce architecture agnostic intermediate code which is then compiled to for the specific architecture on which the code needs to run. This is powerful because it allows for all high level languages only worry about parsing, but the machine code generation is only written once for each architecture. The GCC started doing something similar a while back, but the LLVM has, IMO, done a better job.\nAs an example, asm.js is a new JavaScript spec that defines a subset of JS which can be optimized by the interpreter to be run like machine code. As a consequence there is no need to do Garbage Collection and some of the numbers I've seen show asm.js applications running at 50% native speeds. But, it comes at a cost, asm.js is complex, writing it by hand is difficult, but this is where the LLVM shines, the Emscripten tool is a compiler for translating C and C++ into asm.js. What this means is that for us people who like strongly typed languages, we will be able to use them instead of JS to wrote for the Web, which is really awesome. By extension, this means that Rust too could be used for writing web code.\nWhen should you start using Rust?\nNow, depending on what you need it for. For me, having a predictable runtime (no GC) is important to a project I'm working on. Having that also run at native C like speed is also desirable. If you have a project that also needs this, Rust seems like the perfect fit. If on the other hand you have a high application to build and time critical deadlines to get it into production I'd still stick with Java or Scala to deliver that. Rust doesn't have the same amount of libraries and hasn't been beaten around in production to discover all it's bugs yet. It's also possible that the language will change a bit over time, but this will probably all calm down after the 1.0 release.\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/rust-from-a-java-dev/","title":"Rust from a Java dev"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-1/":{"body":"Not too long ago, 2000 let's say, it was common for developers of software to be so lazy that they didn't even know if their software worked. They wouldn't write unit tests, they wouldn't even bother testing their code. They would throw it over the fence to quality assurance engineers and expect them to say, \"Oh my god this is the greatest code ever, and it works perfectly\". With the exception of the most simple program, this has never actually been the case, hell even Grace Murray Hopper (go Brewers!) couldn't account for literal bugs in the system. This has often caused great angst among real engineers out there and even today people in the Software industry continue to say that Software engineering is not \"Real Engineering\". This is too easy of a copout and let's people off the hook for designing bad software, or using bad techniques.\nIt's not like we're building Bridges!\nThis is a classic argument. Bridges are ridged and have to be designed up front to meet the engineering requirements to span what they are being built for. They are static entities that never change, right? Well, that's not totally accurate, even great engineering feats aren't perfect and need to be fixed, look at the new eastern span of the Bay Bridge. There are a bunch of issues that weren't properly accounted for and now need to be fixed. So, bridges aren't perfect, and need to go back and be fixed, sounds a lot like software. To try and match the way that buildings and bridges are engineered, the Waterfall Method was created (I remember this being taught to me in college as the new cool awesomeness for development). It really seemed like the greatest thing ever.\nYears later I started working at a large company, when I got there they hadn't shipped their planned release for over a year. It was stuck in this cycle of Dev -&gt; QA -&gt; Dev -&gt; Product -&gt; Dev -&gt; QA that was never ending. So this was first hand experience of this awesome technique that I was taught in college, and it's abject failure to deal with real world issues. What's the problem? Software has a million moving parts. It's dynamic by nature. This is why the Bridge analogy breaks down so quickly, but it's just the static bridges that don't match this. Not all bridges are made this way, check out the living bridges in India.\n\nWhat's my point? The issue with Software Engineering isn't that it's not actual engineering, it's that it's Dynamic Engineering. It's constantly adapting and changing to new uses and needs. When you built that website tool it only expected one user at a time, then it blew up and you had like a whopping ten, so you decided it needed to run in parallel. Did you go back and rewrite the entire thing? No, you went back and made it parallel so that all those ten people weren't waiting on each other when they went to your site. Now of course we deal with thousands of connections at a time in an application and so that simple synchronization you did needs to give way to optimistic locking and atomic reads/writes to drastically increase the performance of your application. No locking; again, did you rewrite the entire thing? No, you fixed the weak spots (well unless you wrote it in Ruby and realized that you needed it to actually run fast).\nAlong came TDD\nI remember when Test Driven Development came around. If you know all your inputs and outputs, you can just write the tests for it and then the code will just flow to match your test cases. The problem with this is it shoves Software Engineering back into this idea that it is static and non-changing. The one case I've found it useful is parsing and finite-state-machines, you know all the inputs and expected outputs, so it really does help you validate and write your code faster (let me know if you know of other really good fits). In most cases though, you actually don't know what your inputs are until you design the interface and then try to write the code behind it, only to discover that the interface you designed doesn't allow for nice code to be written after that. In fact, I have found TDD to actually be about as slow as Waterfall in terms of delivery. Ok, so TDD doesn't work, but it did pass on something really important, Test Oriented Development. This term is rising in popularity, but what it means is that the code you write is easily tested through the use of Mocks and Unit tests. So why is this an important development in the field? It shows that there is a discipline to coding, and technique which allows for software to be verified to be correct within whatever bounds you've declared. Ok, now we're getting closer to becoming engineers.\nDude, where's my Bridge?\nIn the American Civil War (War of Northern Aggression for you Southerners) the Confederate army burned many railroad bridges to try and slow the advance of the Union armies. The Trestle bridge construction was used to build bridges quickly and reliably in order to get the Union trains moving. So this is where we come to software as components in a larger system. Object-Oriented design, code reuse, I'll avoid Microservices for right now, maybe a future post. The point is that Components, like the trestle, allow for systems (bridges), to be built faster. The nice thing about this is that like an individual trestle, any component that fails or needs to be changed can be done so without rewriting the entire system. Components must have strong interfaces by which it is known which is in use in software (one reason why I've been attracted to OSGi in the past). So we can build bridges with individual components because each one can be verified individually before inserting into the whole. Unit tests on your components that cover what the expected input and outputs of the components mean that now you have a easy method of verifying a rewrite of that component, and any future rewrites after that.\nSo am I an engineer?\nI build things, I follow strong rules about how I build these things, and I verify that the things I build are correct and fully functional. The entire point of writing this is that I find it annoying that people keep saying that we software engineers are not engineers, that at best we're designers or worst hacks. This is also used as an excuse by lazy developers to not put in proper design and controls in the software they build. This is not true and it's possible to build software both quickly and with a regard to future changes when required. Agility is key and the organization needs to be amenable to Agile development methodologies, with constant iteration to hone in on the ideal system. I follow these rules when building software:\n\nUse Components to create strong Separation of Concerns and boundaries\nUnit and Functional tests to verify those Components\nAll data is Immutable by default for ease of threading\nAny system operation or high level operation should be idempotent and/or atomic\n\nWhat these allow me to do is follow fast iterative design. Create a quick top level design, use that to guide the development of each component down the stack. When guiding large architectures across teams, this is essential. Get initial code out as quickly as possible such that the real world stresses can be discovered and fixed as issues come up, and because you have test harnesses and good boundaries around your component it's easy (ish) to replace. I am a Software Engineer, I follow strong engineering practices around what I do, do you?\nWhat I've left to the reader, proper test design (checkout TestNG for Java and Mockito) and methodology, good Agile development methodologies (pick one). Do your own research.\nI decided to make this a three part piece. The next one deals with testing if you're interested in reading it. The final is about DevOPs\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-1/","title":"Software Engineers are lazy bastards, pt. 1"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-2/":{"body":"Let me start off by explaining why I am calling Software Engineers lazy. This stems from the general principle that people are going to generally do the least amount of work possible to accomplish a given task. Software Engineers are no different; Computer Scientists on the other hand are perfectionists always looking for the most elegant solution to a problem. Perhaps even creating a new theorem or axiom, it's my job as a Software Engineer to understand and utilize these new advancements (and perhaps one day I will create some, I did get a degree in Computer Science after all). Like the CAP theorem or Raft consensus protocol, it's definitely my responsibility to understand the theories behind these and be able to implement them if necessary, but I look at these as things like I beams in construction that can be bought off the shelf. My job as a Software Engineer is to take disparate pieces of technology and put them together to build a larger system. But why are we inherently lazy? Corners will be cut in order to ship software, systems will have components that aren't complete, because we have limited time and money which constrains our abilities to be perfect.\nIn other worlds, the real world intervenes and so what we need to do is find a way to mitigate issues down the road. This is why I'm so adamant about componentization or modularization in my own code, and any team that I'm leading. If that piece isn't perfect, go back and refactor. This post isn't about that, what it's about is how to make each of those components as high quality as possible. But before that let's discuss the quality of airplanes.\nWe need some chicken guns!\nChicken guns, created in the 1950s to test the strength of different components of an airplane.\n\nThey're used to check the strength of both engines and windshields in the event that a large bird hits the airplane. It's exactly what it sounds like, a large pressure gun that shoots chickens at a high velocity to simulate a midair strike (like that potato gun you used to accidentally break the window of the garage at your friends house, no, not me...).  This is obviously important, you don't want to discover during flight with 150+ people on board that the windshield or engines can't withstand something that's fairly common in the air. So the chicken gun is used to make sure we're all safe in case of a mid-air strike with a bird. Cool right?\nThe wingbend test is used to make sure that the aircraft wings aren't going to fall off or apart in mid-flight. It's that fear you have in the back of your mind when the plane is bouncing around in crazy turbulence that one of the wings is just going to pop off and you all go spiraling down to your deaths. Aren't you happy that the wings will bend up to a degree that is so mindbogglingly extreme that you could try a 900 like Tony Hawk on them? But even before this test, they already have subjected the aluminum composites being used to understand their tensile strengths. Testing all the way down to each panel before it's attached to the plane.\nThere are tons of tests that are run through before a plane can even fly. Checking that all the electrical systems, the flaps, etc., are fully functional. Then they actually take the plane into the air for a battery of flight tests. These tests are critical to determine the safety of a plane. Now imagine for a moment that the tensile strength or longevity of the metal wasn't known before the flight test, that the pressures of the initial flight test shows that the internal ribbing of the plane needs to be replaced. How difficult would that be? How much more expensive is it to replace that at the end, than to realize it at the beginning and just choose a different material in the first place? Code quality should be treated in the same way.\nWhat is quality code?\nThis question is always answered in a lot of different ways. Years ago I was working on a project in which I needed to modify some of DJB's code. He writes a quality of code that is impressive. C that's platform independent, big-endian and little-endian compatible. It was a really cool experience to see that amount of thought put into writing software, but I wouldn't say it's easy to grok. While I have the highest respect for what he's done, in my case what I think is just as important is writing code which is easily maintainable. Components help with this, but so do tests. A friend and former coworker of mine introduced me to this idea of a testing pyramid. For a basic overview of this, here's an ok blog post. I'm going to modify that in some important ways, especially since I'm not a UI developer, I won't go into UI testing at all (though I would suggest you need this same structure on the UI side, with actual selenium tests or similar at the top of the pyramid). I'm a backend systems architect, when do I need UI. But in the vein of fighting the lazy software engineer, I think it's important that we software engineers have built tests around each of these areas, here is the pyramid that I implement my code by:\n\nI'll run through each of these sections, but the important thing is that what this represents is that most of your test coverage occurs at the bottom of the pyramid, with ever smaller numbers of tests flowing to the top. From a code complexity standpoint though, the tests at the top of the pyramid are more difficult to write and maintain, therefor there should be fewer of them. I'll start from the bottom up, in fact I'll spend more time describing things bottom up too.\nUnit test your code, fool!\nIf you're not writing unit tests around every class you write, you are a fool. Yes, you are, I know you're saying, \"but that's just a simple function that adds two numbers and returns the result\". But if a function as simple as:\nint myAdd(int i, int j) {\n  int k = i + j;\n  return k;\n}\n\nstill could have a bug! Hell, technically speaking you have an overflow problem that this isn't dealing with where i and j could be max ints and overflow the size of int. Also, it's just as easy to accidentally write 'return i;' and cause a bug in your most trivial code. I'm not suggesting to go crazy, just write a quick sanity test.\nThere is one rule that you must follow though when writing Unit tests, they must be clean of any external dependencies. Don't get stuck initializing a massive tree of dependencies, use Mocks for this stuff (if your a Scala or Java dev and you don't know Mockito, then learn it, right now, it will save your life). If you have to launch a DB to make your unit tests work, those are not unit tests (they are more likely functional or integration tests). So don't do that! You just slow down your development speed because you've made it harder to run your tests, and it takes longer to setup your development environment. I follow these rules on unit tests:\n\nNo external dependencies (i.e. DBs, or other remote services)\nDon't require shared state between tests (or as little as possible)\nAlways make sure your tests can be run in your IDE with no other actions needed than compiling\nTest all expected code paths in a method (i.e. you don't have to go overboard with exception cases)\nIf it's expected to be multi-threaded, write some threaded tests (these are fun, and will teach you a lot about making your code testable)\n\nBy-the-way, a target of 80% code coverage is generally good for unit tests, more than that and you start making reformatting code more difficult. Also, more than this and there are diminishing returns on the tests themselves, you're aiming for checks to make sure your code is going to function properly in production, with tests based on real world issues. Unit tests are your base set of tests, they test the tensile strength of the materials which your later going to use to put together your larger project. Like the aluminum in the plane, if you discover issues this early in your development, your saving yourself a lot of pain (and time) down the road, and your lazy, right? You don't want to spend any extra time writing code than you need to...\n(Quick aside, I dissed Ruby for it's speed in my first post on this, but to be fair the Rubyists really nailed tests living with your code. Rust has taken testing to another level where you can actually include tests in comments, and then have examples that are always confirmed to be uptodate with the code, super cool)\nBut functional tests are way better!\nOk, not really. Functional tests are the next order of tests. As an example, this would be where you test your SQL against your DB (or NOSQL against your non-ACID whatever). Functional tests should only test one thing. I was working on a large project before that had a lot of various external components to work with, one being DNS. It used the dynamic DNS protocol to update the DNS records. First the DNS module was a distinct component in the code such that it had one responsibility, talk to DNS. The functional tests only tested this one component, they did not have any other side-affects, e.g. the DB code et. al. were not dependencies for the tests on this component. From our plane example, this is like the wing-bend test. The plane is put together, but specific functions are being tested to make sure it will be ok in the air, sadly I don't think Tony Hawk could skate on any of the code I've written.\nCool, but functional tests have side-affects, don't they? For DBs and DNS or similar persistent state systems, how do you make sure your tests are starting from a known state? Virtualization! VMs are cool, use them. Use Vagrant to setup your VM, use installation (RPM, DEB, Chef, Docker, etc.) scripts to install the packages, cache the installed VM (so that those steps aren't long in the future), and then clean up all persistent data in the VM before running your tests. It sounds like a lot of pain, but the advantages are awesome; you get to figure out at the beginning of your dev work how your going to install and bootstrap each system, and your guaranteeing that everyone testing is starting from a known point. Pretty awesome and saves you a ton of time later.\nMy rules for functional tests:\n\nOne component is being tested\nAlways start from a known state by cleaning up persistent information each time (at the beginning, not the end!)\nInstall your external components now the way you plan to in the future (save yourself some time and heartache later, hell you might decide it's so ridiculously complex that you changed your mind about using it)\nOnly test high level functionality, the unit tests cover code paths, these tests make sure that your assumptions about the thing your using are correct.\nWhat's great about these tests is that when you discover bugs in the interaction between your code and the external system (yes, there will be bugs this doesn't catch), you get to come back to these and replicate the bugs here. Isolated directly to just this one component without having to worry about other interactions, overtime hardening this component to ridiculous degrees.\n\nOMG, all my inter-team dependencies just got easier!\nIf you're following along, then you'll notice something that you just got for free here. Scrum teams are all the rage these days in large development organizations. If you follow these nice boundaries that your functional tests are helping to guarantee, separate scrum teams can actually work on separate components that will be more likely to work together in the end. It allows those inter-dependent teams to pull in each others tests early and use them to help with their integration tests early. Great for helping deliver code faster in larger organizations. This will make your manager really happy, because they get to focus on all that HR stuff instead of technical problems (which is what they love, right?). And happy managers =&gt; promotions =&gt; more money =&gt; happy and lazy software engineer.\nOk, but I still don't know if my whole system works\nYeah, this is getting repetitive. Integration tests are similar to functional, but this is where you bring things together to make sure they all work. Essentially this just makes sure that when you put your DB in place and your DNS service in place that calling your REST API endpoint actually flows through each component and performs the action you expect. And why is this easy to set up? I know it sounds tedious, but you already have your VMs from your functional tests, reuse them! And again, you get to validate your assumptions about how all of these things will interoperate and what connectivity you need between them before production. Again cool, right?\nRules are the same as for functional tests, but for this you are writing a very minimal set of tests. This is the only place where you do end-to-end tests, in the plane this is akin to the full system tests performed before the flight tests.\nDo we get to fly yet?\nOk, yes, you can fly now. Smoke tests, these validate that your system, after being deployed in production, is working as expected. I used to think that it's enough to run these post deployment only, but then I realized something, there are all sorts of monitoring pieces that need to run constantly to make sure your application is actually working. Use your smoke tests for your monitoring needs! What's the difference between these and integration tests you ask? Not much. The only rule here is that your smoke tests should not damage your production systems, so design your system and the tests to not over time take down your production instances. Oh, and guess what, you can virtualize your system just like you did for your integration tests to test these locally as well. Virtualization is an excellent way of validating your stuff before ever hitting a real deployment, and you can do it while sitting on the beach disconnect from a network on your laptop. If your not using VMs to test your deployment steps, then your just making it harder on yourself to verify this since you'll need to share time on actual full test beds or production.\nBut I'm a lazy bastard, remember?\nSo here's the key to getting to be lazy. What's harder, replacing the ribbing on the plane after it's built, or when you actually choose that material initially? It's the same here, if you have to track down crazy bugs because you never figured out if your stuff actually does the right thing at the most basic levels, debug time in production is much harder. You also didn't give yourself an easy place to replicate production issues to verify a fix before releasing. We've all been there, logging into production systems at 3am trying to figure out what's wrong with the damn system, definitely not lazy, compound that with an enterprise system where you as a developer are not even allowed to touch the production system, so you have to ask someone with production access to check stuff for you, all over the phone (or similar remote technology, because you were happily sleeping at home when this random problem just caused the entire site to crash and of course it was on your on-call night and you'd much rather get back to that dream and sleeping in, and oh my god now I have kids and they'll be up to less that two hours because debugging a system through someone else has already wasted an hour and you've only just gotten the heapdump, because it had to be uploaded to a safe directory so that you could download it, because you're not allowed to log into production! This is definitely not lazy). Remember, at each layer of the pyramid it is more difficult (and thus affects your ability to be lazy) to debug and fix issues as you get higher up the pyramid's stack. So the moral? Don't be lazy at the beginning and skip your testing, be lazy at the end when it all just works. And yes, even after all of this, eventually there will be a battery that ended up catching on fire for (initially) no obvious reason. At least it wasn't the engine blowing up mid-flight...\nIn the third part of this series I'll get into development's relationship with operations, yes, DevOps.\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-2/","title":"Software Engineers are lazy bastards, pt. 2"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-20/":{"body":"Ok so DevOps became a thing. If I understand it properly, which I'm sure lots of people will say I do not, it's the idea that proper development practices are brought to bear on operations problems. This means things like using source code management systems (Git), having code reviews, following a process around work that needs to be done. These are all great things, and it's way better than way that people did this before. But here's the irony, and something I find kinda sad, computers and software were built to automate things. They were built to run factories, to make it easier to compute flight paths, to help with order fulfillment; I'm not going to list out all the places they help, I hope you get the point. So the irony is that DevOps is needed to help automate the systems that we (Software/Hardware/Computer People) built to help automate away other issues. I can't be the only one who sees this as ironically sad. To really make a point here, I'm going to start with an analogy, trains.\nRemember how complicated it was to drive a steam train?\nYeah, me too. You had to fill it with coal or wood, or whatever combustible thing was available at hand. And it was really hot, always sweating, that's why I stopped being and engineer and became a lazy software engineer. Ok, not funny, but still steam trains were really hard to operate. Look at all these dials and levers:\n\nI'm going to guess that the big red lever is the brake (no, no, the one on the right not the left), Oh, and the dial on the left makes it go faster (the heavily used looking one). But seriously, I have no idea. The only thing I'm pretty sure of from this photo is where you put the fuel, and I'm guessing coal.\nSo, why am I talking about trains as a Software Engineer who knows little to nothing about trains? Because that picture above is what us lazy software engineers have been giving the operations folks for years. In fact, operations became so complicated that the operations folks needed to adopt development methodologies to manage systems at scale, and thus was born DevOps. Which is a great thing, using good standards in operations like SCM, releases of tools, declarative systems, etc. these are all great advancements, but why haven't they always been there? And why are they needed? Because as developers we've given operators so many dials to properly run our software (think on every config your require someone to write, every command line option...).\nDevOps should not be necessary\nI blame Java for the state of the world (don't get me wrong, I still love Java though Scala is growing on me as a JVM language). Java and many of the interpreted languages out there put us in a state where the developer actively divorced themselves from the system they were building software for. This was great for being able to build things faster, test it once and expect it to work the same on any platform you deploy to after that. I remember when I had to build a common client/server system in C++ with a network stack that was portable between Windows, Linux and SunOS on x86, amd64, and sparc. Having to build something that worked on all of those platforms and think about how it would run under COM in Windows, daemontools in Linux/SunOS was a major pain and caused a ton of bugs where some needed to be debugged after shipping the software to the customer. I do not want to go back to that, so these VM based languages are always going to have a place for portable code, but I do ask myself this question all the time; Do I need portability? I have only shipped software on one platform for the past 11 years, Linux. But I do think one day I'll probably end up needing to support BSD, so let's just say that I have no intention of supporting a non-POSIX OS from here on in my development career (enter interest in Rust). When software engineers experience the pain of running their own code, they will change it so that it's easier to operate. Why? Because at heart, they are lazy, they want to get back to writing code, not supporting this crappy thing in production. As a comparison, look at modern train controls, even I could probably figure out how to stop this or make it go faster:\n\nThe point is that Software Engineers have gotten lazy in how their code is deployed and run. There have been great advancements over the last four years in the operations world. Everyone has heard of Docker, some rkt, appc, LXC, LXD, etc, all of these are giving us lazy people easy methods of packaging our software. It's easier to implement actual deployment tests upfront now than any point in the past. You don't need to chroot, it's done for you; you don't need to do any port mapping, you can get a unique IP per container or VM; you don't need to guess about installation, you can use the installation tools to create the container image. What this means is that as a developer there is no reason anymore to hand these jobs off to anyone else to validate the functionality of your system. As a Software Engineer today you should know exactly how your software is going to be deployed, run, executed, what your data persistence requirements are, etc. You can not ignore this, and it's never been easier with all the tools that exist out there now. There are lots of methods, you should research what you want. I'll say this, I've been using LXC for over four years, and containers are the way to go. I can't be happier about the OpenContainer spec that was recently announced.\nWhere is this train going?\nI'm watching these things: CoreOS, rkt, Atomic, Nix. I think that Nix is probably going to be the standard way of declaring system dependencies in containers. I think Nix or Atomic (with OSTree) will be the standard way of managing the BaseOS, but CoreOS is probably good enough for now. Work with your operations or DevOps teams to make this possible, as it will help immensely down the road. In other words, the operating system and application environment should be completely declarative.\nSoftware Engineers are not actually lazy\nI know I called software engineers lazy bastards, and that probably stopped half of them from reading these posts, but I actually don't think we're lazy bastards. We got caught up in the methods and complexities of the day and forgot to stay grounded. Basically if you want to be lazy, it's important to be lazy after your software is built and functioning properly. Which means to be a good Software Engineer you need to keep these three areas in mind when building software:\n\nModular and Component based systems (pt. 1)\nTesting without relying on others (pt. 2)\nDesign your software to be easily deployed and managed (pt. 3, this one)\n\nIf you make good decisions in each of those categories, most likely you'll get to go back to being lazy and working on what you really want, and isn't that ultimately everyone's goal?\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-20/","title":"Software Engineers are lazy bastards, pt. 3"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/static-web-app-rust/":{"body":"I am not a frontend engineer. I don't generally have the patience for figuring out how to make something look the way I want; on top of that, all web work basically requires a knowledge of Javascript. I have no qualms in saying that I don't enjoy writing Javascript. This has basically kept me out of the web frontend space, even on hobby projects. But now I can target the web with my favorite language, Rust and deliver WASM. This post is about a minor little adventure in learning some of the tools for doing this.\nKitchen Patrol\nMy family gets together in the summer at a cabin in the middle of nowhere. There are a lot of us, and each day has a set of work that needs to be done for everything to come together and no individuals being overtaxed with the effort. My sister-inlaw, being expert in organization, years ago devised a chore chart for all the work. Everyone gets assigned a job, somewhat indiscriminately (though age is a requirement for some jobs), the main goal being that no person does two major jobs in a day (like cooking for 24 and also doing all the dishes after the dinner). Filling this out always took time and energy, so this year I told her, \"hey why don't we build something for it?\". So with her acting as the project manager and me the engineer, it was time to write an application to take care of this. Now I get to share that experience, and don't judge too harshly, my web UI skills are basically non-existent.\nI got my inspiration from this much more detailed and impressive post, A web application completely in Rust. So if you want to really learn this, you should read that, not this. After reading that I realized now is a good time for me to try this. Every year, I decide to take a stab at some frontend development, mainly to keep up with the changing ecosystem. After reading the linked to article, it made it clear we would now be able to do something decent in Rust with minimal, even no, Javascript, awesome.\nDesign\nI had a few goals:\n\nonly use Rust for code (except CSS and initial index.html)\ntarget WASM, because this is the future ;)\nlearn Yew, and see what it's like (build up components from scratch)\nbuild it as a static site (no backend, learn/use LocalStorage)\nbuild it as a single-page-app, it's literally one page\n\nHere's what the chart itself will end up generating (all names are fake):\n\nInitially this was a static page. I implemented it with a statically generated list of people and jobs (the jobs and number of days are still static). I decided the first thing we'd make dynamic would be the list of people associated to the jobs, for that we'd need another form that will look like this:\n\nAs I'm no expert in the area, I decided not to fret too much if I couldn't get things to look right, again, if you're going to be bothered with fonts or look, you want to go elsewhere. Just for reference, the look/feel I was going for was a legal pad with a marker.\nGetting started\nThis all builds off the excellent work done on stdweb and cargo-web. For this we won't be using stdweb directly, though it is necessary for a component which uses &lt;select/&gt;, but instead the Yew framework. I went with this directory structure (mostly standard):\ndocs/      # contains the static site for Github pages\nsrc/       # the Rust source code\nsrc/data/  # non-web specific components (there's a simple CLI)\nsrc/web/   # all web components\nstatic/    # static content to be included with the app\nstatic/index.html  # starting point for the App (very simple)\nstatic/styles.css  # our stylesheet\nCargo.toml # Rust configs\nWeb.toml   # cargo-web configuration\n\nFor all the web components I put them into src/web and only compile that when the (default) feature web-spa is enabled. If I was going to build a \"prod\" application, I'd probably have this src/web be a separate crate all together.\nLet's get the environment ready:\n$&gt; cargo install cargo-web\n\nWoh, that's it! That will also install wasm32-unknown-unknown toolchain into your rustup env. Btw, you'll be needing the nightly rustc, so switch to that (also, I had a problem with compiling some of the tools on the most recent Rust version, so I needed to use nightly-2018-07-17):\n$&gt; rustup default nightly-2018-07-17\n\nFor our dependencies in Cargo.toml it isn't much:\n[dependencies]\nserde = \"1.0\"\nserde_derive = \"1.0\"\nserde_json = \"1.0\"\nstdweb = \"0.4\"\nyew = \"0.4\"\n\nAnd now we're ready to write some code.\nComponents\nSome of this stuff is documented well, other parts less so. To generate the docs, I needed to use the stable compiler, as there were some issues with nightly, but it's definitely worth generating those:\n$&gt; cargo +stable doc --open\n\nI have spent a little time familiarizing myself with Vue and React (only so far as tutorials and play apps in the past). I found the Yew framework to be very reminiscent of React, it claims to be \"inspired by Elm and ReactJS\" (I've never worked with Elm).\nThere are two traits Component and Renderable. Component implements all of the functions around creating and updating the component. Renderable implements the functions for rendering the component, view. It's not yet clear to me why these two are separate traits and not just one, there's possibly a good reason, but it's not obvious to me yet. Component has three functions, create, update, and change; change is only required if your component carries a custom set of properties, this requirement is enforced at runtime (errors get spewed to the javascript console).\nLet's look at our simplest component for the Chart. First the types:\n#[derive(Clone)]\npub struct Chart {\n    // this is a version marker we're using for determing when to reload data\n    people_version: usize,\n    // the actual chart data, for display\n    week: Week,\n}\n\n/// The chart properties, it just let's us know what version of the data we need\n#[derive(Clone, Default, PartialEq)]\npub struct ChartProps {\n    pub people_version: usize,\n}\n\nNow the implementation of the chart's calculate function that will create the data for the chart: \nimpl Chart {\n    /// Our calculate function will construct a new week for the chart\n    fn calculate(context: &amp;mut Context) -&gt; Self {\n        context.console.debug(\"calculating new week\");\n        // jobs are static\n        let jobs = kp_chart::default_jobs();\n\n        // We'll come back to this, it's restoring the set of people from the\n        //  local store\n        let (people_version, people) = PeopleStore::restore(&amp;mut *context)\n            .map(|p| (p.inc, p.people))\n            .unwrap_or_else(|| (0, kp_chart::default_people()));\n        Self {\n            people_version: people_version,\n            // we're calculating 5 days worth of jobs\n            week: kp_chart::calculate(5, jobs, people),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAnd then here is the component implementation, which is pretty simple:\nimpl Component&lt;Context&gt; for Chart {\n    type Message = ();\n    type Properties = ChartProps;\n\n    // Initial state of the component, we're ignoring the props\n    //   because the storage version will always be loaded here.\n    fn create(_props: Self::Properties, context: &amp;mut Env&lt;Context, Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {\n        context.console.debug(\"creating Chart\");\n        Self::calculate(&amp;mut *context)\n    }\n\n    // we don't accept any messages.\n    fn update(&amp;mut self, _msg: Self::Message, _context: &amp;mut Env&lt;Context, Self&gt;) -&gt; ShouldRender {\n        true\n    }\n\n    // for changes, we're going to update our chore chart if the version is different from the one we already have.\n    fn change(\n        &amp;mut self,\n        props: Self::Properties,\n        context: &amp;mut Env&lt;Context, Self&gt;,\n    ) -&gt; ShouldRender {\n        if self.people_version != props.people_version {\n            context.console.debug(\"updating Chart\");\n            *self = Self::calculate(&amp;mut *context);\n            true\n        } else {\n            false\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the above we're not actually doing a lot. The actual logic for the calculation is not complex (and needs to be better). It currently rotates through all the people and jobs, selecting between adults, teens, and children for each job. I'm hoping that the Yew console logging will eventually be integrated into the Rust logger that most people use, but it's easy enough to use.\nThe view function is here for rendering:\nimpl Renderable&lt;Context, Chart&gt; for Chart {\n    fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html&lt;Context, Self&gt; {\n        let header = |name: &amp;str| {\n            html!{\n                &lt;th&gt;{ format!(\"{}\", name) }&lt;/th&gt;\n            }\n        };\n        let people_cell = |people: &amp;[Person]| {\n            let mut people_str = String::new();\n            for person in people {\n                people_str.push_str(person.name());\n                people_str.push_str(\", \");\n            }\n\n            html!{\n                &lt;td&gt;{ people_str }&lt;/td&gt;\n            }\n        };\n        let job_row = |(job_idx, job): (usize, &amp;Job)| {\n            let days = self.week.days();\n            html!{\n                &lt;tr&gt;{ header(job.name()) } { for days.iter().map(|d| people_cell(d.get_job_people(job_idx))) }&lt;/tr&gt;\n            }\n        };\n\n        html! {\n            &lt;&gt;\n                &lt;h2&gt;{\"Job Chart\"}&lt;/h2&gt;\n                &lt;table&gt;\n                    &lt;thead&gt;\n                        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;{\"Job\"}&lt;/th&gt; { for self.week.days().iter().map(|d| header(d.name())) }&lt;/tr&gt;\n                    &lt;/thead&gt;\n                    &lt;tbody&gt;\n                        { for self.week.jobs().enumerate().map(|j| job_row(j)) }\n                    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n                &lt;/table&gt;\n            &lt;/&gt;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe above showcases the pretty amazing html! macro that gives us something very much like JSX. It's quite impressive in how it works, but has some interesting quirks. For example, notice the for ... construction. As I understand this, you need to something that is IntoIterator&lt;Item=yew::html::Html&gt;, this is why we call out to another function for the actual header(...) and job_row(...) rendering. It's really quite an amazing macro.\nThis component is used in the RootModel, which is the top-level component. Let's look at it's usage:\nimpl Renderable&lt;Context, RootModel&gt; for RootModel {\n    fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html&lt;Context, Self&gt; {\n        use web::Chart;\n\n        html! {\n            &lt;div&gt;\n                &lt;h1&gt;{\"Kitchen Patrol Charts\"}&lt;/h1&gt;\n                // This is the binding for the Chart model:\n                &lt;Chart: people_version={self.people_version},/&gt;\n                // Continue reading for discussion the PeopleModel...\n                &lt;PeopleModel: on_save=|inc| RootMsg::PeopleUpdated(inc),/&gt;\n            &lt;div/&gt;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nYou see in the above snippet, people_version={self.people_version} is the property that is bound to our properties type, ChartProps::people_version, which is very elegant, and vaguely like the React system, except that it's type-safe and validated at compile time! Honestly, this is my excitement for Rust in this context. We can have the elegance of HTML templates that live alongside the component implementation, and with cargo web start we even get a similar development experience to Javascript of the immediately updated experience during development. It's extremely hard to express my excitement here, as to me, Javascript is a hostile development environment, with many issues only discoverable at runtime. That is juxtaposed to this experience of compile time guarantees creating a sense of security so long lacking in web development.\nNow for a bit more complexity, you'll notice in the previous example this property:\n&lt;PeopleModel: on_save=|inc| RootMsg::PeopleUpdated(inc),/&gt;\n\nMessaging events between components\nThis introduces some message passing. The RootMsg::PeopleUpdated(inc) enum type will be passed back to our RootModel on the (custom) on_save event. This is ultimately tied into an onclick DOM event binding to a save &lt;button/&gt; in the PeopleModel:\nhtml! {\n    //...\n    &lt;button onclick=|_| PeopleMsg::SavePeople, &gt;\n        &lt;i class=(\"fa\", \"fa-floppy-o\"), aria-hidden=\"true\",&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n    //...\n}\n\nThat on event calls through the PeopleMsg::SavePeople message type, which is processed in the PeopleModel::update function:\nmatch msg {\n    PeopleMsg::SavePeople =&gt; {\n        context.console.debug(\"saving PeopleModel\");\n        let mut people: PeopleStore = self.clone().into();\n        people.store(&amp;mut *context);\n        *self = PeopleModel::from(people, self.on_save.take());\n\n        self.on_save.as_ref().map(|e| e.emit(self.inc));\n        true\n    }\n    _ =&gt; (),\n}\n\nThis emits the event to the upstream RootModel via PeopleModel::on_save callback that was registered through the properties passed in on the RootModels creation of the PeopleModel via the RootModel::view method. Of course when the people model is saved, it needs to write it somewhere. Yew makes all of this very simple and easy. Of course, when you save something, it generally should be preserved somewhere and for this I had decided to only use LocalStorage in the browser, of course this means there are no backups and the data is tied to the access location, but still very cool. To use this, we just need to add the service to our Context type:\npub struct Context {\n    pub console: ConsoleService,\n    pub local_store: StorageService,\n}\n\nThe storage service is registered as Area::Local:\nlet context = Context {\n    console: ConsoleService::new(),\n    local_store: StorageService::new(Area::Local),\n};\n\nAnd this is easily updated and used as [String]'s (json in this case).\nAll of this was really fun to do; thank you to Denis Kolodin for Yew, it was a pleasure to learn and use. And now, you can use the ugly static app here: https://bluejekyll.github.io/kp-chart/. The only thing server side is the loading of the static files: index.html, kp-chart.js (binding javascript for the WASM), kp-chart.wasm, and styles.css. After that everything is 100% on the client. When you save it will preserve to LocalStorage in your browser. I've tested this on iOS Safari, macOS Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. It all seems to work perfectly. What's also really cool, is there is no server side required at all, once compiled the files can be loaded directly from the filesystem and run as an SPA, which is really cool (at least on Firefox).\nHere are links to all the components I implemented for this, i.e. nothing off the shelf:\n\nRootModel - starting point for the application\nChart - chart/table of the rendered jobs and people\nPeopleModel - people edit form\nPeopleStore - storage object that reads and writes itself to LocalStorage (not a component)\nEditDelete - Edit and Delete component for changing and removing people\nPersonName - Person name field for displaying and editing a person's name\nPersonAbility - Person ability, aka age, field for displaying and editing a person's age\n\nPretty cool stuff I think, and none of it seems more complex than React. In point of fact, I think it's simpler because the compiler tells you when you've made any mistakes in your code.\nFearless web development\nRust already taught to be fearless in regards to systems programming while working on TRust-DNS, now it's showing me that I can be fearless when working with frontend web design. While this little web-app wasn't much, it shows me that Rust is going to be amazing in this space, especially for those of us that enjoy the hand-holding of rustc.\nAll the code for this can be found here: kp-chart\nsome gotchas:\n\nmultiple classes on a type:\n\nI wanted to write &lt;i class=\"fa fa-trash fa-fw\", aria-hidden=\"true\" /&gt;, but instead we must write &lt;i class=(\"fa\", \"fa-trash\", \"fa-fw\"), aria-hidden=\"true\", /&gt;.

I read that\nand realized that much of the future work that I wanted to do on TRust-DNS would\nbenefit from porting from MIO to futures-rs and tokio-rs. Also, since no one\nactually pays me for any of this work, I get to choose what to work on when,\nand what I think is the most important thing to deliver. This is such a huge leap for Rust that it was completely worth adding a couple of months to the delivery of new features.\nThis[1] is the story of the journey into the future; including the pain, the joy and some thoughts on the future. I will forewarn you that should you attempt to follow this path, things will probably have changed quite a bit during the time that this was written and when you attempt the journey. I should also mention, that I built most of this somewhat isolated from the on-going development around tokio-rs, so it's completely likely that I have made decisions that are not idiomatic according to people more deeply involved in that effort.\nWhat is Async I/O? (briefly)\nTo understand where we are going, you must first understand what asynchronous input and output (async I/O) is and why it is important. In network software (all I/O based software in fact), there are basically two forms of I/O. The standard one which people generally learn first is blocking I/O. In blocking I/O operations you write some code like:\nlet socket = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1:52\");\nlet mut buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(512);\n\nsocket.recv_from(&amp;mut buffer).unwrap();\n\nThat recv_from(..) is a blocking request. It will never return until there is data to receive from the socket, i.e. a packet arrives at the specified port. A big negative consequence of using blocking I/O is that in order to execute any other logic, a new thread would need to be created.\nIn non-blocking, async I/O there is a substantial difference: it will not block (hard to guess from the name I know); instead it will return immediately and tell you it's not ready. For example:\nlet socket = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1\");\nsocket.set_nonblocking(true);\nlet mut buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(512);\n\nloop {\n  match socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buffer) {\n    Ok((_)) =&gt; /* do something with data */,\n    Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock =&gt; {\n      /* do something while waiting */\n      continue\n    },\n    error =&gt; return error,\n  }\n}\n\nThe code is more complex, but it has a special feature: instead of blocking you get the nice option of doing something else when there is no data ready. The really cool thing about this is that you can create two or more execution paths in your code, without threads. To learn more,  Richard Stevens and his tomes on \"UNIX Networking Programming\" remain excellent reading in my opinion, there may be better resources now but I still pull those off the shelf from time to time. If your program is small, and not used much, then blocking I/O has traditionally been the easier thing to use, but to do anything concurrently you need to turn to threads. Threads are expensive, and when there are many of them, they can cause scalability issues due to resource consumption and context switching.\nThe holy grail is when async, non-blocking I/O becomes as simple to write as synchronous I/O, and tokio-rs is doing that for Rust.\nYou said you had fun with MIO\nNon-blocking I/O is the fundamental building block for asynchronous I/O operations, and subsequently, event driven systems. Many operating systems have higher order utilities for building event driven network software. POSIX defined poll and select, Linux has epoll, the BSD's use kqueue, and Windows IOCP (with which I am not personally familiar). These libraries provide an API for registering a lot of I/O handles, sockets, in a central place such that it's simpler to ask if any of those handles are ready in one system call.\nMIO, metal I/O, is awesome because it's an abstraction over these different OS primitives. When I first used it, I was completely amazed at how seamlessly it works across all OSes. It's still a fairly low level interface, just one step above the others. In order to use it properly, it was important to build many state machines. Here is an example of the state machine for the TCPListener:\nimpl DnsHandler for TcpListener {\n  fn handle(&amp;mut self, events: EventSet, _: &amp;Arc&lt;Catalog&gt;) -&gt; (Option&lt;EventSet&gt;, Option&lt;(DnsHandlerType, EventSet)&gt;) {\n    if events.is_error() { panic!(\"unexpected error state on: {:?}\", self) }\n    else if events.is_hup() { panic!(\"listening socket hungup: {:?}\", self) }\n    else if events.is_readable() || events.is_writable() {\n      // there's a new connection coming in\n      // give it a new token and insert the stream on the event listener\n      // then store in the map for reference when dealing with new streams\n      for _ in 0..100 { // loop a max of 100 times, don't want to starve the responses.\n        match self.accept() {\n          Ok(Some((stream, addr))) =&gt; {\n            info!(\"new tcp connection from: {}\", addr);\n            return (Some(EventSet::all()), Some((DnsHandlerType::TcpHandler(TcpHandler::new_server_handler(stream)),\n                                                !EventSet::writable())))\n          },\n          Ok(None) =&gt; {\n            return (Some(EventSet::all()), None)\n          },\n          Err(e) =&gt; panic!(\"unexpected error accepting: {}\", e),\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    // this should never happen\n    (Some(EventSet::all()), None)\n  }\n}\n\nThis is registered into an MIO event loop. I worked to come up with an abstraction with which I was happy. This needs to support building state machines for different protocols, currently just UDP and TCP are supported; there are other transits that I hope to support with TRust-DNS (of course, PR's are always welcome). You'll notice in the above implementation I'm dealing with the raw events. It took a little bit to get this logic correct, and I don't think there are any bugs in it. If there are bugs, it doesn't matter because I deprecated all the MIO based modules; they await the great executor of deletion. After reading about futures-rs and tokio-rs (which is built on top of MIO) I immediately recognized that there would be great benefits to switch to those tools. It paid off really well. Here is the same logic as above, but utilizing the tokio-rs TcpListener and the Incoming stream:\nlet listener = tokio_core::net::TcpListener::from_listener(..);\n\n// for each incoming request...\nself.io_loop.handle().spawn(\n  listener.incoming()\n          .for_each(move |(tcp_stream, src_addr)| {\n            debug!(\"accepted request from: {}\", src_addr);\n            // take the created stream...\n            let (buf_stream, stream_handle) = TcpStream::with_tcp_stream(tcp_stream);\n            let timeout_stream = try!(TimeoutStream::new(buf_stream, timeout, handle.clone()));\n            let request_stream = RequestStream::new(timeout_stream, stream_handle);\n            let catalog = catalog.clone();\n\n            // and spawn to the io_loop\n            handle.spawn(\n              request_stream.for_each(move |(request, response_handle)| {\n                Self::handle_request(request, response_handle, catalog.clone())\n              })\n              .map_err(move |e| debug!(\"error in TCP request_stream src: {:?} error: {}\", src_addr, e))\n            );\n\n            Ok(())\n          })\n          .map_err(|e| debug!(\"error in inbound tcp_stream: {}\", e))\n);\n\nActually, this isn't the same as the MIO based implementation. This implementation collapses two of the original state machines into one. It both accepts requests from the TcpListener, and also spawns a new Future to handle the newly established TcpStream. The TRust-DNS client was the first thing rebuilt on these new tools, which took a lot longer than anticipated. The payoff came when it literally took two nights to implement the new ServerFuture: one for UDP and the other for TCP.\nWhile it may not be obvious at first glance, this implementation is both much simpler and also shows some very powerful features of building on top of tokio-rs. It's no longer dealing with raw events for one thing. Also, notice the wrappers around TcpStream (that's a TRust-DNS TcpStream), timeout_stream (will timeout if a TcpStream is inactive) and request_stream (deserializes bytes into DNS requests). Because everything is now based on futures-rs, it's now dead simple to combine different state machines to create awesome abstractions. Let me break this down a little more.\nThe internal vs. external state of a Future\nThe Future trait in Rust follows the std libraries dedication to chained function interfaces. Let's take a look at a subset of it's function traits quickly:\npub trait Future {\n    type Item;\n    type Error;\n    fn poll(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Item, Self::Error&gt;;\n\n    fn map&lt;F, U&gt;(self, f: F) -&gt; Map&lt;Self, F&gt; where F: FnOnce(Self::Item) -&gt; U, Self: Sized { ... }\n    fn and_then&lt;F, B&gt;(self, f: F) -&gt; AndThen&lt;Self, B, F&gt; where F: FnOnce(Self::Item) -&gt; B, B: IntoFuture&lt;Error=Self::Error&gt;, Self: Sized { ... }\n    fn or_else&lt;F, B&gt;(self, f: F) -&gt; OrElse&lt;Self, B, F&gt; where F: FnOnce(Self::Error) -&gt; B, B: IntoFuture&lt;Item=Self::Item&gt;, Self: Sized { ... }\n    fn select&lt;B&gt;(self, other: B) -&gt; Select&lt;Self, B::Future&gt; where B: IntoFuture&lt;Item=Self::Item, Error=Self::Error&gt;, Self: Sized { ... }\n    fn join&lt;B&gt;(self, other: B) -&gt; Join&lt;Self, B::Future&gt; where B: IntoFuture&lt;Error=Self::Error&gt;, Self: Sized { ... }\n}\n\nThese allow you to chain executions together based on the Future's success or failure. Some quick definitions, and then I'll show a practical use case:\n\npoll()- 'drives' the Future, i.e. check it it's complete\nmap()- process the successful result of a Future and return some other value\nand_then()- on success, do something, then return a new Future\nor_else()- on failure, counterpart to and_then()\nselect()- select this or another Future, whichever finishes first\njoin()- join two futures waiting for both to succeed\n\nWhile migrating TRust-DNS to tokio-rs those are the functions I found most useful. You should explore the documentation for more details.\nLet's ignore poll() for a minute, the other functions allow for what I like to think of 'external state' to be captured in the processing logic after a Future yields a result. A good example of this is in SecureClientHandle, which is responsible for proving a DNSSec chain:\nself.client\n.send(message)\n.and_then(move |message_response|{\n  debug!(\"validating message_response: {}\", message_response.get_id());\n  verify_rrsets(client, message_response, dns_class)\n})\n.and_then(move |verified_message| {\n  // at this point all of the message is verified.\n  //  This is where NSEC (and possibly NSEC3) validation occurs\n  // As of now, only NSEC is supported.\n  if verified_message.get_answers().is_empty() {\n    let nsecs = verified_message.get_name_servers()\n    .iter()\n    .filter(|rr| rr.get_rr_type() == RecordType::NSEC)\n    .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();\n\n    if !verify_nsec(&amp;query, nsecs) {\n      return Err(ClientErrorKind::Message(\"could not validate nxdomain with NSEC\").into())\n    }\n  }\n\n  Ok(verified_message)\n})\n\nIn this snippet from the function, it is using a ClientFuture, the TRust-DNS tokio-rs based DNS client, to send a query. Subsequent to a successful response  after sending the future query, it then validates all the resource record sets returned from the server. If the processing is also successful, it then checks to see if the responses were actually NSEC records, which then triggers additional logic to validate a negative cache response. Each of those operations send(..), and_then(..), and_then(..) captures the logic to be performed at each state transition, i.e. 'external state'. This is pretty cool, and I'm sure all you functional programmers are thinking \"duh\", but for me, learning to use this has been a very eye-opening experience.\nNow Coming back to poll(..), this is our internal state function. Sadly, most of my code here is fairly complex, you can take a look at UdpStream and TcpStream[2] for the actual inner I/O examples, but I don't want this post to be excessively long, so let's look at a simpler one, TimeoutStream:\npub struct TimeoutStream&lt;S&gt; {\n  stream: S,\n  reactor_handle: Handle,\n  timeout_duration: Duration,\n  timeout: Option&lt;Timeout&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;S, I&gt; Stream for TimeoutStream&lt;S&gt;\nwhere S: Stream&lt;Item=I, Error=io::Error&gt; {\n  type Item = I;\n  type Error = io::Error;\n\n  fn poll(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Poll&lt;Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;, Self::Error&gt; {\n    match self.stream.poll() {\n      r @ Ok(Async::Ready(_)) | r @ Err(_) =&gt; {\n        // reset the timeout to wait for the next request...\n        let timeout = try!(Self::timeout(self.timeout_duration,      &amp;self.reactor_handle));\n        drop(mem::replace(&amp;mut self.timeout, timeout));\n\n        return r\n      },\n      Ok(Async::NotReady) =&gt; {\n        if self.timeout.is_none() { return Ok(Async::NotReady) }\n\n        // otherwise check if the timeout has expired.\n        match try_ready!(self.timeout.as_mut().unwrap().poll()) {\n          () =&gt; {\n            debug!(\"timeout on stream\");\n            return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::TimedOut, format!(\"nothing ready in {:?}\", self.timeout_duration)))\n          },\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOk, I realize I haven't mentioned Stream's yet. Simply put, they are Futures which return more than one result: they return streams of results! I know - totally unexpected. For Java hacks out there, this shouldn't be confused with Java Streams, which are more similar to Rust's Iterator; oh, you shouldn't click that link, you will get jealous... in fact, can someone implement this in Java Streams? I took a crack at it, and it wasn't obvious that it would be easy...\nThe poll() operation above simply does two things: it checks if the inner Stream is ready to yield data, or it checks to see if the timeout Future has expired. The entire point of this stream implementation is to guard the server against unused TCP connections. I'm sure the authors of tokio-rs will look at this and think there are better ways to implement this timeout, but this felt the cleanest to me (I would of course love feedback). In the case where there is data, the timeout is reset. If it did timeout, an error will be returned, and further up the stack the connection will be closed. For people unfamiliar with TCP, this can't be done with simple receive timeouts on the socket because those don't guard against a client which might be trickling data in over extended periods of time. This forces the client to send a full query a minimum of X number of seconds or the connection will be closed.\nThat's pretty cool, right? Or maybe I'm crazy for loving this stuff.\nTo thread or not to thread?\nSo now that you have a complete and total understanding of tokio-rs and futures-rs, we can move to some really exciting topics, like, concurrency. At the very beginning, I mentioned that you could \"do something while waiting\" for a future I/O event to occur. This is where futures-rs has some really nifty stuff to offer. I/O and especially network I/O can take a long time (in CPU terms), which means there's lots of other stuff you can do in that time, like, more I/O! It blew my mind when I realized what join() and select() are in futures-rs, they are functions that actually allow for concurrent execution of code, but without threads! I bet you want to see an example. Let's look at the SecureClientHandle again. In DNSSec, there may be many DNSKEYs present in a zone. DNSKEYs are used to sign records and produce RRSIGs which are signed records for a particular resource record set. This might be a little hard to picture, so let's illustrate it with one:\n\nTo trust the A records requires fetching each of the records back to the ROOT in order to validate it. TRust-DNS validates records from the bottom up (it can also be performed top down for public domains), the proof is anchored with the ROOT CERT. The public key for this certificate is available to anyone who seeks it; TRust-DNS compiles this key into the binaries. Any chain is valid, once you have a proof that all the records in the chain are signed back to a valid anchor. TRust-DNS allows for custom anchors to be associated with clients, as part of the Rust API (there is no host or dig binary for TRust-DNS yet, though I'd like to at least add host at some point).\nThe chain basically works like this: The ROOT zone, aka ., stores a DS record for any valid DNSKEY which the com. zone has registered. The DS record is a hash of the DNSKEY, which is the public key associated to the private key used to sign RRSETs and produce the associated RRSIG, which is a cryptographically signed hash of the RRSET (the only thing that would make that run-on-sentence better is if it was recursive, which the proof algorithm is). In the above example there are two valid RRSIGs for the www resource record, 1 and 2. These were produced by two different DNSKEYs, which both had two different DS records that validate those DNSKEYs and so on. 3 was signed with an invalid DNSKEY, there are legitimate reasons for invalid keys to exist in the wild (i.e. it's not necessarily a hacked domain or attempted man-in-the-middle): one case would be that keys are currently being rotated. Even though it might eventually be a valid key, DNSKEY 3 can not be trusted, and RRSIG 3 must be thrown away.\nIf you've read up to this point then I bet you're really excited for some code. Here is another snippet from SecureClientHandle:\nfn verify_rrsets&lt;H&gt;(\n  client: SecureClientHandle&lt;H&gt;,\n  message_result: Message,\n  dns_class: DNSClass,\n) -&gt; Box&lt;Future&lt;Item=Message, Error=ClientError&gt;&gt;\nwhere H: ClientHandle {\n  let mut rrset_types: HashSet&lt;(domain::Name, RecordType)&gt; = HashSet::new();\n  for rrset in message_result.get_answers()\n      .iter()\n      .chain(message_result.get_name_servers())\n      .filter(|rr| rr.get_rr_type() != RecordType::RRSIG &amp;&amp;\n      // if we are at a depth greater than 1, we are only interested in proving evaluation chains\n      //   this means that only DNSKEY and DS are intersting at that point.\n      //   this protects against looping over things like NS records and DNSKEYs in responses.\n      // TODO: is there a cleaner way to prevent cycles in the evaluations?\n                   (client.request_depth &lt;= 1 ||\n                    rr.get_rr_type() == RecordType::DNSKEY ||\n                    rr.get_rr_type() == RecordType::DS))\n      .map(|rr| (rr.get_name().clone(), rr.get_rr_type())) {\n    rrset_types.insert(rrset);\n  }\n\n  // collect all the rrsets to verify\n  let mut rrsets = Vec::with_capacity(rrset_types.len());\n  for (name, record_type) in rrset_types {\n    // collect the RRSET from the answers, name_servers and additional sections.\n    let rrset: Vec&lt;Record&gt; = message_result.get_answers()\n        .iter()\n        .chain(message_result.get_name_servers())\n        .chain(message_result.get_additionals())\n        .filter(|rr| rr.get_rr_type() == record_type &amp;&amp; rr.get_name() == &amp;name)\n        .cloned()\n        .collect();\n\n    // collect the RRSIG that covers that RRSET from the same sections.\n    let rrsigs: Vec&lt;Record&gt; = message_result.get_answers()\n        .iter()\n        .chain(message_result.get_name_servers())\n        .chain(message_result.get_additionals())\n        .filter(|rr| rr.get_rr_type() == RecordType::RRSIG)\n        .filter(|rr| if let &amp;RData::SIG(ref rrsig) = rr.get_rdata() {\n          rrsig.get_type_covered() == record_type\n        } else {\n          false\n        })\n        .cloned()\n        .collect();\n\n    // create the RRSET for evaluation.\n    let rrset = Rrset { name: name,\n      record_type: record_type,\n      record_class: dns_class,\n      records: rrset\n    };\n\n    debug!(\"verifying: {}, record_type: {:?}, rrsigs: {}\", rrset.name, record_type, rrsigs.len());\n\n    // push a VerifyRrsetFuture into the rrsets to validate.\n    rrsets.push(verify_rrset(client.clone_with_context(), rrset, rrsigs));\n  }\n\n  // spawn a select_all over this vec, these are the individual RRSet validators\n  // these occur in \"parallel\"\n  let rrsets_to_verify = select_all(rrsets);\n\n  // return the full Message validator\n  Box::new(VerifyRrsetsFuture{\n    message_result: Some(message_result),\n    rrsets: rrsets_to_verify,\n    verified_rrsets: HashSet::new(),\n  })\n}\n\nThere is a lot of code there; I've removed a bit, but I thought it would be interesting to see something more complex. This function is intended to be called as part of a function chain of a Future, if you scroll up you can see where this is called, which means that this function and it's logic will only be run on a successful request. What happens here is that the Rrsets which need to be validated are collected with their related RRSIGs. These sets of futures from verify_rrset are then passed to select_all(), which is magic. It returns a SelectAll future which issues all of those proofs in parallel! This means that creating parallel execution blocks of events waiting for responses from I/O streams, in this case an upstream DNS server, is dead simple. There are still no threads, which is amazing! The abstractions with futures-rs will of course work with anything, not just I/O futures which tokio-rs provides.\nI'd be remise if I didn't mention that in this example there isn't really a ton of concurrency going on. The reason for this is that in the context of the DNS client, only a single connection is being used. To reduce the number of queries being sent I implemented two Futures. One is MemoizeClientHandle which will store/cache results from queries during a DNSSec evaluation. I don't want to add to the already significant amount of DNS traffic out there unnecessarily. That Future at it's core uses RcFuture which is a Future that will return copies of references to an inner future result, or the result if it's finished. RcFuture is a purely generic Future, which could be used in any other context. RcFuture makes the trade-off that it's cheaper to clone(), aka copy, the data than it is to query the data. The fact that I could just add these Futures as wrappers to existing logic, should make some of the benefits of these two libraries and the paradigm apparent.\nThe future is now\nThese abstractions are excellent. By adopting futures-rs for TRust-DNS, and specifically tokio-rs, it means that these should integrate easily with any code which also chooses to use tokio-rs. Based on my experience, if you're doing I/O in Rust, you probably should be looking at using tokio-rs. Now, everyone is going to ask, \"do you have benchmarks? I heard Rust is faster than a cheetah! Prove it!\". Well, I finally added some bench tests to TRust-DNS, with a test harness for running BIND9 as a comparison. Sadly, it turns out by just writing something in Rust you don't end up with the fastest program ever. The story of making TRust-DNS fast is not part of this post. You're going to have to wait until my next post where we can discover how to benchmark TRust-DNS, profile it, and then make it faster; the goal, of course, being to make it faster than BIND9. To be fair, I haven't been trying to make TRust-DNS fast. Until now I've been trying to make it correct, safe, and secure. Currently the server processes requests in 400µs.\nIf you want to play with the TRust-DNS futures, ClientFuture was published in the 0.8 release. The ServerFuture will be coming in 0.9, for which there is not yet a date, but probably soonish. 0.9 also will split the server and client into separate crates, so keep an eye out for that. I plan to implement DNS over TLS, multicast DNS and other things, which will all be simpler now, because I can have a single common high level interface for interacting with any of them. Fun, right? It has me dreaming of all the things that I did in the past, and how I can make them better in the future.\nThank you!\nThank you to @alexcrichton for helping guide me through some initial issues I had when implementing the UDP and TCP streams. Also, thank you to all of the contributors of furures-rs and tokio-rs who made all of this possible. A huge thank you to the contributors of TRust-DNS; I deeply appreciate your efforts in helping drive this project forward.\n\n\n1) Taking TRust-DNS IntoFuture is a pun, not a typo on the type IntoFuture in the futures-rs library.\n\n\n2) I implemented these streams prior to tokio_core::io::Framed being stabilized. I'd highly recommend looking at that for request/response type protocols.\n\n\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/trust-dns-into-future/","title":"Taking TRust-DNS IntoFuture"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/trust-dns-resolver/":{"body":"I released the initial version of the TRust-DNS Resolver recently. Version 0.1.0, the version is offset from that of the TRust-DNS library, which is up to 0.10.4 at the time of this writing. When I started this project my main goal was to make a DNS server which was easy to manage, and a client which could be used to manage it in a secure way. As I've marched forward in implementing all of the features I've wanted, it started becoming clear that people are more interested in the Client than the Server. It really struck me when I got issue #109, \"use the system's dns conf, e.g. /etc/resolv.conf\"; of course what everyone really wants to use is a simple query interface to get IP addresses. The rest of this post is about building this initial version.\nWhat else has been happening\nSince my last post I've been heads down at night on TRust-DNS. Writing posts hadn't really been at the top of my mind, but there have been a lot of new features and patches! TRust-DNS has gained support for TLS in that time, probably the other big feature. There are three variants supported: OpenSSL by default; native_tls which uses the host system's TLS implementation; and rustls which is backed by the amazing ring project. I made a claim in my previous post about the Tokio framework which was that TRust-DNS would \"... integrate easily with any code which also chooses to use tokio-rs.\" All of the TLS libraries I mentioned have Tokio wrappers, because of this it was actually simple to integrate them into the TRust-DNS library! It's exciting to know that Tokio really is as composable as it promises to be. I'm not completely done with TLS, when I finish up more support for mTLS in the Server and Client I'll post more information about that. On top of that, the DNSSec public and private key implementations have been cleaned up, and some fixes applied. Please see the Special thanks section below.\nDNS Resolvers\nI had always planned to implement a full resolver in TRust-DNS, but it had never bubbled up to a high priority for me. As the Client has gained more users, the requests and confusion around using a raw Client made it clear that it was time to build one. At it's most basic a Resolver is responsible for going from a set of labels and resolving that to a set of records, following any NS[1] records as necessary until an SOA[2] is found for the zone. It also has the responsibility of following CNAME[3] chains until a final record is found. A Client is only responsible for the connection to a name server, the Resolver uses the Client to connect to as many name servers as necessary to fulfill a query on a set of labels (Name). As of now the TRust-DNS Resolver isn't recursive, it only sends a single request and relies on the upstream resolver for any necessary recursion.\nIt's at points like this that it's worthwhile to mention that everything I know about DNS has been gleaned from operating and using DNS servers in various contexts and reading lots of RFCs. I have never in the past actually written a DNS server, a client, nor a resolver. So if you're reading this post, or any of my previous posts and notice that I've gotten something wrong, please file an issue in the TRust-DNS repo. Seriously, I won't be offended.\nNameServerPool\nThere were some fun aspects of building this library. Probably the most interesting thing is the NameServerPool, this is a simple pool for managing connections to a set of remote DNS servers. Most systems specify two DNS resolvers to use for resolution in the /etc/resolv.conf or similar. I thought it would be fun to track the performance of each connection and rank them as they are used. For this Rust has a nice BinaryHeap in the stdlib. This a queue which allows for the connections to be ordered in priority order such that the highest priority item will be retrieved on the next call to the queue. Right now I'm not tracking a lot of information, just successes and failures at the moment (in the future I want to add latency as another):\n#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]\nstruct NameServerStats {\n    state: NameServerState,\n    successes: usize,\n    failures: usize,\n}\n\nThe BinaryHeap requires us to implement Ord and PartialOrd to return an Ordering of the elements in the queue:\nimpl Ord for NameServerStats {\n    /// Custom implementation of Ord for NameServer which incorporates the performance of the connection into it's ranking\n    fn cmp(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Ordering {\n        // if they are literally equal, just return\n        if self == other {\n            return Ordering::Equal;\n        }\n\n        // otherwise, run our evaluation to determine the next to be returned from the Heap\n        match self.state.cmp(&amp;other.state) {\n            Ordering::Equal =&gt; (),\n            o @ _ =&gt; {\n                return o;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // invert failure comparison\n        if self.failures &lt;= other.failures {\n            return Ordering::Greater;\n        }\n\n        // at this point we'll go with the lesser of successes to make sure there is ballance\n        self.successes.cmp(&amp;other.successes)\n    }\n}\n\nThis \"algorithm\" is quite simple. It says that if they are not equal, then the first thing is to compare the state of the connection, of which there are three: Init, Established, Failed. Connections that have never been established, i.e. they are in the initial state, will be preferred. After that whichever connection has fewer failures will be chosen. To try and introduce a little bit of load balancing after that, we choose the least successes. There are some obvious improvements that should be made to this. I'd like to come up with a better way of calculating weights, i.e. some numeric value that is computed based on all these inputs and spits out the highest priority connection. On top of that, it would be good to bucket failures and successes over different time periods such that a connection that initially failed is tried again and isn't permanently starved. For example, it would be interesting if you could list all the NameServers you want to use globally (say on a laptop), and the library transparently handles picking the best one.\nTo calculate these stats ends up being really easy with Futures, for example here's the send() method implemented on NameServer:\n    fn send(&amp;mut self, message: Message) -&gt; Box&lt;Future&lt;Item = Message, Error = ClientError&gt;&gt; {\n        // if state is failed, return future::err(), unless retry delay expired...\n        if let Err(error) = self.try_reconnect() {\n            return Box::new(future::err(error));\n        }\n\n\nThe first thing we do (above) is check and see if the connection needs to be reconnected (TCP and TLS need this). This is an individual NameServer in the pool, if it's connected this is a noop. After that we grab references to the stats (stored in Mutexs for Sync), these are passed to the and_then and or_else Future result handlers:\n        // grab a reference to the stats for this NameServer\n        let mutex1 = self.stats.clone();\n        let mutex2 = self.stats.clone();\n        Box::new(self.client.send(message).and_then(move |response| {\n            let remote_edns = response.edns().cloned();\n\n            // this transitions the state to success\n            let response = \n                mutex1\n                    .lock()\n                    .and_then(|mut stats| { stats.next_success(remote_edns); Ok(response) })\n                    .map_err(|e| format!(\"Error acquiring NameServerStats lock: {}\", e).into());\n\n            future::result(response)\n        })\n\nIn the above example the stats increment the success of the request, and_then will only be executed if the client returns on a successful query. Otherwise, we go to or_else:\n        .or_else(move |error| {\n            // this transitions the state to failure\n            mutex2\n                .lock()\n                .and_then(|mut stats| {\n                    stats.next_failure(error.clone(), Instant::now());\n                    Ok(())\n                })\n                .or_else(|e| {\n                    warn!(\"Error acquiring NameServerStats lock (already in error state, ignoring): {}\", e);\n                    Err(()) \n                })\n                .is_ok(); // ignoring error, as this connection is already marked in error...\n\n            // These are connection failures, not lookup failures, that is handled in the resolver layer\n            future::err(error)\n        }))\n    }\n\nWhich of course tracks the failure. The NameServerStats object is a StateMachine, where next_failure actually transitions the connection into a Failed state. This all works with BinaryHeap because it exposes a method for performing a peek_mut where the wrapped value in a PeekMut&lt;T&gt; will be reprioritized in the queue after the reference is dropped. This is handled in the NameServerPool::send method:\n    fn send(&amp;mut self, message: Message) -&gt; Box&lt;Future&lt;Item = Message, Error = ClientError&gt;&gt; {\n        // select the highest priority connection\n        let conn = self.conns.peek_mut();\n\n        if conn.is_none() {\n            return Box::new(future::err(ClientErrorKind::Message(\"No connections available\")\n                                            .into()));\n        }\n\n        let mut conn = conn.unwrap();\n        conn.send(message)\n    }\n\nI did double check implementation of PeekMut to actually verify this functionality (and there is also a test case for it in trust-dns-resolver), I want to submit some improvements to the docs here in the stdlib. What's great about this implementation is that two async requests can be submitted back to back, and the highest priority connection will always be chosen, never actually removed from the pool! This is different from a database connection pool, for example, as everything is async; there is no need to remove and return connections to the pool, as you would with a synchronous connection to a database.\nA side note on pub(crate):\nThis is a really nice new feature in Rust for library maintenance. We've just reviewed some code above from two internal objects in the Resolver library. In the TRust-DNS client library, there are a lot of interfaces public that really don't need to be. The issue with this is that it increases the surface area that has been published from the TRust-DNS client library to include things that I really only want to be usable within the project. In the Resolver I get to use the new pub(crate) feature (introduces in Rust 1.18) which restricts the public interfaces to be only available within the crate. In affect this means that most internals (like NameServer and NameServerPool) of the Resolver library will not be public. This also helps because it will direct users to the interfaces I want them to use, namely: Resolver, and LookupIp. e.g.: \npub struct Resolver {...}\n\nvs. the internal only:\npub(crate) struct NameServer {...}\n\nwhich is very nice. I do wish this had existed in the beginning, but it's great that it does now.\nWhat about DNSSec\nI want TRust-DNS to always be validating DNSSec records, and reject unsigned records. This is actually one pillar of the project that I'm proud of; I'm still amazed it works to be honest... One thing I haven't been able to figure out is what to do with records that fail DNSSec validation. If this were a user application like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari then you would expect a dialogue warning the user, but that's not something I can handle for any downstream project. On top of that, the current implementation of the SecureClientHandle will strip invalid records from the return record set. This will not work for anyone that wants the option of using a record even if it failed validation. So my plan is to update the result from the SecureClientHandle to return validation failures in an Error variant. I'm of course open to other ideas, so please send them my way, I have an issue open for discussion.\nWork left to do on the Resolver\nThere are still a few things that need to be implemented in the Resolver:\n\nAAAA (IPv6) in addition to the A (IPv4) lookup performed today: FIXED #159\nUsing the system resolv.conf for configuration: FIXED #109\nConnection latency measurements: #158\nBetter fairness in the NameServerPool: #157\nIntegrate TLS support: #156\nDNSSec validation: #155\nFix SecureClientHandle to offer an error result of invalid RecordSets: #154\n\nSpecial Thanks\nTRust-DNS has grown in complexity, supports multiple crypto libraries and multiple DNSSec algorithms, and three different TLS libraries. I tried to get this stuff correct when I wrote it originally, but for some of the variants I didn't have good public sites that I could reliably validate the code with, and getting the RFCs correct isn't easy. This is a special thank you to: SAPikachu for fixing multiple complex issues in the library, SAPikachu has an impressive ability for tracking down and fixing opaque problems; briansmith for fixing some issues in the storage of ED25519; liranringel for the AppVeyor build support; jannic for fixing SIG(0) interoperability with BIND; and of all the other contributors. Your support is greatly appreciated, and has raised the quality of this project significantly. Also, I really couldn't have built this project with out the great work on Rust and the many dependencies upon which the project relies. If any of you will be at the RustConf this year, please hit me up, I owe you each at least a drink of your choice. If anyone else will be at RustConf and wants to talk DNS, Tokio, Rust, or children and life; please find me there!\nAnd of course a huge thanks to my wife, Lyndsey, and both kids who give me some time most days to work on this project and support me in everything else.\nThank you!\np.s. @gcouprie, I hope this one is up to your standards.\n\n\n1) NS - Name Server records are pointers to other DNS servers which are known to be authorities for a zone in question. For example, example.com. has an NS record which points to b.iana-servers.net.\n\n\n2) SOA - Start Of Authority record which defines some default values for the zone, every zone requires one to be valid.\n\n\n3) CNAME - Canonical Name record acts as an alias for another record. A CNAME only aliases names, which means it can only act as an alias for one other record type, at the name of the CNAME record, there can only be one (except in DNSSec with regards to RRSIG records). This restriction is important now that we have A, IPv4, and AAAA, IPv6, records in a zone. It means that even if you are dual stack, you can't have a CNAME record which has an A and AAAA aliases at the same time. CNAMEs can also point to other CNAMEs, effectively creating a chain of names.\n\n\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/trust-dns-resolver/","title":"The *new* TRust-DNS Resolver"},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/type-parameters/":{"body":"A while back I was writing some Rust, and the compiler yelled at me, it's such a perfectionist. Luckily it also gave me a very helpful hint about how to fix the problem. I copy-and-pasted the hint into my code (yeah I know, you just lost some respect for me), and promised myself to go back and understand why later. I finally had to write some new code that used these interfaces and so I got to revisit the error message and why it was necessary. Before we get into that argument with the compiler, it might be helpful to walk down memory lane with Generics.\nMy brief history with \"Generics\"\nMy first introduction to the concept of Generics was with the C++ Template system in a Computer Science class in College. It's been a while, but I still have this typedef name in my head, interator (notice the 'int-erator', an iterator of integers). I had typedeffed it to reduce my typing throughout the code, it was something like:\ntypedef std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator interator;\n\nTo this day I frequently mistype iterator as interator... crazy how that stuff can stick with you. Most of my time was actually spent with Java and it's Generics system, though. It was definitely something initially missing from Java after switching from C++ (they were finally added in 1.5). Some people don't like Generics, let me just say, I am firmly in the camp of Generics being awesome. An example of why Generics are necessary in Java is most obvious with collections like Map, before Generics:\nString foo = \"foo\";\nString bar = \"bar\";\n\nArrayList vec = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(\"abc\", \"123\"));\nString str = \"123\";\n\nMap map = new HashMap();\nmap.put(foo, vec);\nmap.put(bar, str);\n\n// we need to cast because map.get() returns Object, not ArrayList\nList list = (List)map.get(foo);\n// ClassCastException! this is a String, but this map doesn't care!\nList not_list = (List)map.get(bar);\n\nWith Generics we can at least turn that into a compile time error. Compile time errors mean things don't blow up in production, effectively giving you a free unit test:\n// A Map of String to an Object which implements List\nMap&lt;String, List&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, List&gt;();\nmap.put(foo, vec);\n// compiler error! expected List, found String\n//  one less runtime bug!\nmap.put(bar, str);\n\n// If we got here, there would be no need to cast!\nList list = map.get(foo);\n// the compiler never even got here!\nList not_list = map.get(bar);\n\nAnd then I started learning Rust...\nYou thought you knew Generics? Welcome to Rust\nRust definitely raises the conceptual bar with it's Generics and type system. To understand why, it's important to understand the difference between monomorphism and runtime[1] polymorphism (to clarify, my usage of polymorphism is specifically in regards to dynamic runtime polymorphism, see comment below). Object Oriented languages all support polymorphic functions. In C++ this (runtime polymorphism) is opt-in with the virtual keyword, and in Java it's opt-out with the final keyword. Rust also supports runtime polymorphism with Trait Objects, to use it you must cast a reference to a to a trait object, for example:\nlet obj = Object::new();\nlet trait_obj = &amp;obj as &amp;Trait;\n\nThis makes Rust similar to C++ in the sense that runtime polymorphism is opt-in. The issue with this is that at runtime it's a little bit more expensive. So what do we do to make this less expensive? We get to use monomorphism, and this is where the Generic system in Rust shines. Let's quickly review polymorphism in Rust:\ntrait Animal {\n  // default impl, don't most animals have 4 legs? j/k\n  fn num_legs(&amp;self) -&gt; usize { 4 }\n}\n\n// Define a Dog and implement Animal for it\nstruct Dog;\nimpl Animal for Dog {\n  // use the default impl\n}\n\n// Define a Chicken and implement Animal for it\nstruct Chicken;\nimpl Animal for Chicken {\n  fn num_legs(&amp;self) -&gt; usize { 2 }\n}\n\nfn print_num_legs(animal: &amp;Animal) {\n  println!(\"legs: {}\", animal.num_legs());\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let dog = Dog;\n    let chicken = Chicken;\n    \n    // Notice the cast to the Trait Object\n    print_num_legs(&amp;dog as &amp;Animal);\n    print_num_legs(&amp;chicken as &amp;Animal);\n}\n\n\nThe above print_num_legs function is polymorphic, because it operates on the concept of Animal. This is a bit of a contrived example, obviously. An interesting difference between Rust and C++/Java at this point is where the opt-in/opt-out of polymorphism occurs. In Rust it's from the reference to the Animal object, but in C++/Java, it's actually in the definition of the class itself. Initially this struck me as odd, but only because I wasn't used to it. Now of course I find it funny that C++ and Java did it the other way (C++ also requires references to objects for polymorphism, if the variable is stack based, then polymorphism will not come into play in the way that it always does in Java). Runtime polymorphism comes at a cost, and that's the fact that when you cast a reference to a Trait Object the compiler must capture additional information behind the pointer to that memory, mainly the virtual function table. This is the table of functions which the object, Dog for example, implement with references to the function actually provided by that instance of the object.\nThis cost can be removed by using monomorphism, and if you're following along (and I'm doing a decent job explaining), Generics. It should be mentioned that runtime polymorphism comes at the cost of runtime memory, where as monomorphism comes at the cost of additional binary size. There is no free beer here. The logic from above isn't all that different, it all comes in the print_num_legs function definition:\nfn print_num_legs&lt;A: Animal&gt;(animal: &amp;A) {\n  println!(\"legs: {}\", animal.num_legs());\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let dog = Dog;\n    let chicken = Chicken;\n    \n    // Notice no cast is necessary\n    print_num_legs(&amp;dog);\n    print_num_legs(&amp;chicken);\n}\n\nThis is now a monomorpic call. The compiler literally generates different code for each variation of the call to print_num_legs. This reduces our runtime cost, but we get to keep the nice fact that we still only needed to write a single function for all types of Animals.\nGeneric experts only\nOk, now that we're all experts with polymorphism and monomorphism in Rust, let's dive deeper in to the depths of this type system. Take a look at the interface that tripped me up and took a while to understand, from here:\npub fn new&lt;CC&gt;(client_connection: CC) -&gt; SecureSyncClientBuilder&lt;CC&gt;\n  where CC: ClientConnection,\n        &lt;CC as ClientConnection&gt;::MessageStream: Stream&lt;Item=Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error=io::Error&gt; + 'static\n\nOMG, that is a complex signature! Let's break it down, but first a quick review of Generics in Rust:\n// A normal function\nfn normal(a: &amp;str) { println!(\"{:?}\", a) } \n\nBut what if we want that same function to work with any type? We add a Generic Type Parameter:\nfn generic&lt;T&gt;(a: T) { println!(\"{:?}\", a) }\n\nThis doesn't compile because we didn't tell Rust that you can print the type T with Debug, let's do that:\nfn generic&lt;T: Debug&gt;(a: T) { println!(\"{:?}\", a) }\n\nThat's nice and simple. But here's the thing, Generics are just other parameters to the function, TypeParameters. By using the term parameter, it helps with understanding more complex use cases. For example, if you want to cast one variable from one type to another you do this with traditional values:\n// Cast the 32 bit number, 128 to an 8 bit number\nfn cast() -&gt; u8 { 128_u32 as u8 }\n\nTypeParameters work just the same way! To show what I mean, we need to build up to a more complex example:\n// inline TypeParameter with Trait bound\nfn fun_generic&lt;T: Add&lt;T, Output=T&gt;&gt;(a: T, b: T) -&gt; T { a + b }\n\n// equivalent with a where clause\nfn fun_generic&lt;T&gt;(a: T, b: T) -&gt; T where T: Add&lt;T, Ouput=T&gt; { a + b }\n\nThe Output parameter of the Add trait is an Associated Type, it's defined like this:\ntrait Add&lt;RHS = Self&gt; {\n    type Output; // associated type\n    fn add(self, rhs: RHS) -&gt; Self::Output;\n}\n\nThis allows the return type, Output to be declared separately from the Add trait. The trait bound for add basically says this, add can be defined for any type, but it can only be added to itself (turns out I learned something new today, the RHS is just defaulted to the same type, see examples below [2]). This means that 2 /*usize*/ + \"3\" /*&amp;str*/; is not legal. It does allow us to change the output though. Let's make up some types, say BitField8 and BitField16 types. We'll define add on BitField8 which will append one to another and return a BitField16:\nstruct BitField8(u8);\nstruct BitField16(u16);\n\nimpl Add&lt;BitField8&gt; for BitField8 {\n  type Output = BitField16;\n  \n  fn add(self, rhs: Self) -&gt; Self::Output {\n     let high: u16 = (self.0 as u16) &lt;&lt; 8;\n     BitField16(high + rhs.0 as u16)\n  }\n}\n\nThis isn't very useful, but it shows what is possible with the Generics system in Rust and it's various TypeParameters and AssociatedTypes. This is all very powerful in giving us strong type checking in lots of different cases.\nNow something completely different\nNow for why I wrote this post, grokking all of these concepts to fully understand the line that confounded me before. I titled this post, They're not Generics; they're TypeParameters because for me just saying TypeParameter to myself allowed me to better grasp what is going on in this complex signature: \n/*1*/ pub fn new&lt;CC&gt;(client_connection: CC) -&gt; SecureSyncClientBuilder&lt;CC&gt;\n/*2*/  where CC: ClientConnection,\n/*3*/        &lt;CC as ClientConnection&gt;::MessageStream: Stream&lt;Item=Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error=io::Error&gt; + 'static\n\nLet's disect it line-by-line. CC is the only direct TypeParameter it's used in both a function parameter and the return type:\n/*1*/ pub fn new&lt;CC&gt;(client_connection: CC) -&gt; SecureSyncClientBuilder&lt;CC&gt;\n\nIn our where clause we are putting a bound on CC, it's a ClientConnection, it could have multiple additional bounds, like Send. The original code doesn't add Send, but let's do it here to make something clearer:\n/*2*/ where CC: ClientConnection + Send,\n\nMessageStream is an associated type on the ClientConnection, like Output in Add. For various reasons this complexity was needed, it's mainly for TCP and TLS connections where unlike UDP we first have to establish a connection to the remote endpoint, so a generic TypeParameter allows this new function to operate on all three of those connection types.\n/*3*/       &lt;CC as ClientConnection&gt;::MessageStream: Stream&lt;Item=Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error=io::Error&gt; + 'static\n\nNotice something funky here, we are \"casting\" CC to ClientConnection, why? Coming from Java with no AssociatedTypes this was very foreign, but it makes sense when you think about what's going on in this statement. CC could be either ClientConnection or Send, so we need to \"cast\" it to the actual type on which we want to add additional bounds for it's associated type, in this case MessageStream. CC could be any type of it's bounds, and by \"casting\" it we are making it clear to the compiler which AssociatedType of which Trait we are referring to.\nTo finish this off, the MessageStream is then bound to the type Stream&lt;Item=Vec&lt;u8&gt;, Error=io::Error&gt; + 'static. This is just saying that MessageStream is a Stream of future data of the type Vec&lt;u8&gt;; the raw, binary DNS packet. The additional 'static bound just specifies that the Stream must either have a 'static lifetime or be an owned type.\nBefore taking TRust-DNS to 1.0, I want to go back and review these interfaces and see if they can be simplified. If anyone has ideas on that, please file an issue on the repo.\nGrokked\nThe reason I wrote this post is because these concepts were something which confused me when initially working with Rust. By literally starting to think in terms of TypeParameters, it has helped clarify some of what is going on when writing generic code. The type system in Rust is so much more advanced than any other language that I've used; I'm still getting used to thinking about it in terms that make sense to me. I hope you found this post useful, apologies if you found it meandering.\np.s. Posting to your blog is a great learning potential, some corrections:\n\n\n1) Above the way in which I refer to the difference between polymorphism and monomorphism was incorrect, I attempted to correct most locations in the post. Polymorphism is the general term for multiple types implementing the same common interface. This does not necessarily imply that the functions must be dynamically called at runtime, in fact generics are generally a subset of polymorphism. The term monomorphism is the specific feature of the compiler to replace function calls to polymorphic functions with a separately compiled code path. Thanks for the correction!\n\n\n2) In the Add example I wrote above, it actually is possible to define add on two different types. I've expanded the example from above:\n\n\nstruct BitField8(u8);\nstruct BitField16(u16);\n// added this additional third type\nstruct BitField32(u32);\n\nimpl Add&lt;BitField16&gt; for BitField8 {\n  // when you add 8 bits to 16, you need enough space, i.e. 32 bits\n  type Output = BitField32;\n  \n  fn add(self, rhs: BitField16) -&gt; Self::Output {\n     let high: u32 = (self.0 as u32) &lt;&lt; 16;\n     BitField32(high + rhs.0 as u32)\n  }\n}\n\nIt turns out that in Add&lt;RHS = Self&gt;, the RHS only defaults to Self. This makes more sense after being corrected.\n","id":"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/type-parameters/","title":"They're not Generics; they're TypeParameters"}},"docInfo":{"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/about/":{"body":48,"title":2},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/compiling-libvirt-and-continuing-use-of-polkit/":{"body":423,"title":5},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/osgi-classpaths-and-jersey/":{"body":215,"title":3},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/outdated/osgi-jetty-jersey/":{"body":656,"title":3},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/a-year-of-rust-and-dns/":{"body":1783,"title":3},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/announcing-hickory-dns/":{"body":504,"title":3},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/announcing-pg-extend/":{"body":1569,"title":7},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/await-trust-dns/":{"body":669,"title":4},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/branchless-rust/":{"body":487,"title":2},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/making-trust-dns-fast/":{"body":2908,"title":5},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/moved-to-github/":{"body":18,"title":2},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/moved-to-zola/":{"body":90,"title":2},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/multicasting-in-rust/":{"body":2284,"title":2},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/my-bike-is-rusty/":{"body":883,"title":2},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/rust-and-the-most-elegant-fsm/":{"body":767,"title":3},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/rust-from-a-java-dev/":{"body":1030,"title":3},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-1/":{"body":735,"title":6},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-2/":{"body":1515,"title":6},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/software-engineers-are-lazy-bastards-20/":{"body":652,"title":6},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/static-web-app-rust/":{"body":1385,"title":4},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/trust-dns-into-future/":{"body":2088,"title":4},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/trust-dns-resolver/":{"body":1223,"title":4},"https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/posts/type-parameters/":{"body":1226,"title":4}},"length":26},"lang":"English"};
