I am a Software Engineer. I've enjoyed it for 20+ years, and plan to keep on hacking for a lot longer. It's a hobby, a job, and there's always something new to learn. You may find me posting on coding, computing, or cycling; the important c's in life. After discovering Rust in 2015, it has become a passion to work with.

I don't post often; I post whenever I think I have something interesting to share.
