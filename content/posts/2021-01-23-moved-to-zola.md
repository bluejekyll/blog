# 301 Moved Permanently

Moved to Zola from Jekyll. Will be so much easier to maintain, the promise of Rust. Zola supports aliasing, so all old blog posts should have their alias with redirect to the new location.

I followed these instructions from [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).
